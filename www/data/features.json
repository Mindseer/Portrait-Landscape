After studying law for two years, Humphries joined the Melbourne Theatre Company. In 1955 he created his archetypes of suburban mediocrity:  Mrs Edna Everage, a Moonee Ponds mother and housewife, her longsuffering husband Norm, and the washed-out, ruminative Sandy Stone. From the late 1950s Humphries performed in his own one-man shows in Australia, Britain, Europe and the US, and Edna Everage held court with increasing flamboyance in shows including Housewife, Super-star; Edna, the Spectacle; and Eat Pray Laugh!, which Humphries announced would be her last. In 2000 Humphries won a Special Tony Award, a Drama Desk Award, a Theatre World Award, and an Outer Critics Circle Award.  He was the subject of the National Portrait Gallery's first large-scale biographical exhibition in 2002.  His many books include two different autobiographies, More Please (1992) and My Life as Me (2002) as well as an autobiography of Edna Everage, My Gorgeous Life (1997) in which the meeting between Humphries and Everage is described in detail. Clifton Pugh and Barry Humphries became friendly in the 1950s and Humphries sometimes went to stay at Dunmoochin, Pugh's home in the bush near Melbourne. Pugh's portrait of Humphries looking 'haunted, angular and aesthetic' - the very first work acquired by the National Portrait Gallery - was painted there. Through his association with Pugh, Humphries's schoolboy interest in art revived, and Pugh helped him mount an exhibition of his works in the gallery of the Victorian Artists' Society. The exhibition featured some collaborative collages by Humphries and Pugh and an installation of boxes of 'Platytox', a shocking product purportedly designed to eradicate the platypus and most marsupials. Humphries has continued to paint over the intervening years.

Subsequently, he appeared in Storm Boy (1976), Mad Dog Morgan (1976), The Last Wave (1977) and Crocodile Dundee (1986); portrayed Bennelong in the television series The Timeless Land (1980); and had roles in other Australian television productions including Homicide and Rush.

White was born in London to a family of Hunter River graziers and spent his youth between England and Australia, at one point returning from study abroad to work as a jackeroo. After a spell as an intelligence officer in North Africa during World War II, he returned to Australia with Manoly Lascaris. The two men lived first at rural Castle Hill, north of Sydney, and later in Centennial Park, partners for fifty years while White's friendships with many others were turbulent and often cruelly curtailed. White's novels include The Aunt's Story, The Tree of Man, Voss, Riders in the Chariot, The Vivisector, The Eye of the Storm, and The Twyborn Affair. During the 1970s, becoming increasingly depressed at Australians' complacency and superficiality, White spoke out on various political issues including nuclear disarmament and heritage preservation. He refused honorary doctorates from Cambridge, the University of Sydney and the Australian National University. Flaws in the Glass (1981) is White's 'straight' autobiography. By contrast, Memoirs of Many in One (1986) is a novel in which the elderly female protagonist - a kind of exuberantly cross- dressed White - delights in taunting her prim old friend, the character Patrick White. David Marr's superb biography of White was published in 1991; shortly before he died, White read the manuscript, and wept, but did not request any changes.

She scored her first national championship title in the 220 yards freestyle in 1955. Later that year, she set new Australian records in four events and in early 1956 won the national 110 and 220 yards freestyle titles, the latter in world record time. At the Melbourne Olympics, Fraser established another world record in winning the 100m freestyle and was part of the gold medal-winning 4 x 100 metres relay team. She won the 100 metres again in Rome in 1960 and in Tokyo in 1964, making her the first swimmer, male or female, to win the same event at three consecutive Olympics. In total, between 1956 and 1964, Fraser broke thirty-nine world records, won four gold and four silver Olympic medals, and became the first woman to swim 100 metres freestyle in under a minute. She might have won the race again, but for a competition ban of ten years imposed after she was arrested for souveniring an Olympic flag. In 1999, Fraser was named World's Greatest Living Female Water Sports Champion by the International Olympic Committee; and Australian Female Athlete of the Century by the Sports Australia Hall of Fame. Australian of the Year in 1964, she later worked as a publican and served a term in the New South Wales Parliament as the independent member for Balmain.

After her ancestral land was appropriated for cattle grazing, she worked as a stockhand. As she grew older she became a leader in women's ceremonial business, experienced in ceremonial body painting. From 1977 she collaborated in the production of batik, an important industry for the Anmatyerre after they regained land title. She first painted on canvas in 1988. In the course of her brief career she produced thousands of canvases depicting the flowers, roots, dust and summer rains of her country, the translucent colours built up with layered touches of paint to create an illusion of depth and movement. In 1998 a retrospective exhibition of Kngwarreye's work, Alhalkere - Paintings from Utopia, travelled to three state galleries and the National Gallery of Australia. Ten years later Utopia: The Genius of Emily Kame Kngwarrey, an exhibition of 120 of the artist's works, showed in Osaka and Tokyo. With that exhibition, Kngwarreye was recognised as one of the very greatest abstract artists of the twentieth century. Jenny Sages (b. 1933) came to Australia as a fifteen-year-old, trained in art in New York and travelled for some years before returning to live in Sydney, where she worked as a commercial illustrator for magazines including Vogue. At the age of fifty she went to the Kimberley, and significant aspects of her life up until that time simply fell away. She gave up commercial illustration to become a full-time artist, concentrating on abstract and landscape works. For more than twenty years she went out annually to 'walk the land' with women companions. On one of her early expeditions, she arranged to meet Emily Kngwarreye. Having charmed her way onto a plane with some German curators, she had to wait for four days for the older woman to turn up with her mob. Emily thought Jenny was as old as she was; they were about the same size; and Sages recalls that they sat and talked 'as two eighty-three-year-olds do'. Sitting with Kngwarreye, Sages poured her impressions onto paper, annotating drawing after drawing with her sitter's remarks. Back in her Sydney studio, she developed the huge, spare painting that became a foundation work for the Portrait Gallery. Along with it into the collection came the drawings that she made under the 'talking tree', capturing the changing expressions on the Anmatyerre woman's face, her shifts between lively and impassive postures, and the things that she said as she first embraced, then tired of, the process.

Born and educated in Adelaide, he became interested in politics at university and joined the ALP partly through his friendship with Don Dunstan.  After serving as its unusually youthful secretary from 1973 to 1981, he formed a Canberra consultancy, providing business and political advice and lobbying.  In the early 1980s Combe was central to the major political scandal known as the 'Combe-Ivanov affair'.  From 1985 to 1991 he was a senior trade commissioner in Canada and then in Hong Kong.  Senior Vice President of Southcorp Wines from 1991 to 2000, he is credited with establishing that company's enormous export operations.  Between 2001 and 2007 he held corporate positions with Evans and Tate Ltd and Simon Gilbert Wines Ltd; he has been Patron of the Don Dunstan Foundation since 2004.  The so-called 'Combe-Ivanov affair' developed out of a trip Combe and his wife made to the USSR in 1982, in the course of preparations for which they met and developed a relationship with the First Secretary for the USSR, Valeriy Ivanov.  Soon after the formation of the Hawke government ASIO raised concerns that Combe, closely aligned to the ALP, may be being 'cultivated' by a Soviet citizen with KGB links.  Ivanov was expelled from Australia in 1983. The highly publicised events were investigated by the Hope Royal Commission into Australia's security and intelligence agencies of 1983-1984, which found that Combe had indeed been targeted by the Soviets.  Though he was cleared of suspicion of spying, Combe, said Bob Hawke, had been compromised, and 'understood and accepted' that government ministers could no longer deal with him as a lobbyist.  This portrait was tipped to win the Archibald Prize of 1983, but just before the announcement of the Prize the judges opted for another.  David Combe said in 1998 that there was 'circumstantially a good case to believe that some trustees were heavied by the Party' into rejecting the work, but this is an idea that those trustees - including a former union leader - have repudiated.

His unique landscape vision emerged in the late 1950s, after his return from a period of study and work in London. The 1960s saw an increasing minimalism in his paintings, which reached its most extreme point at the end of the decade. In his monumental works of 1969, he attempted to evoke the vast scale of the Australian land through canvases of a single colour dotted with tiny flecks of paint. Although Williams later turned to representation of denser, more colourful country, his bare, uncompromising pictures of the 1960s contributed profoundly to subsequent interpretation of the Australian landscape. Williams painted few self portraits; this painting, one of the very first acquisitions of the National Portrait Gallery, was the last and most considered of them. The quiet assurance of the artist, dressed rather formally in suit and tie, coincides with the increasing maturity of his landscape vision in the early 1960s. The work of painting is emphasised; here is no tousle-haired, tortured genius but a diffident, sober man going about his business. Although the self portrait seems quite different from a 'typical' Williams landscape, the treatment of the jacket is reminiscent of that of rocks and trees in his landscapes of the same period and the work is characteristically enlivened with touches of vibrant colour on cheekbones and ears.

They married in 1946 and shortly afterwards moved to Eltham north-east of Melbourne where Betty worked at the local high school as a French and English teacher. In 1967, she founded La Mama in Carlton, an independent theatre modeled on the original in New York. Local actors, writers, directors, poets and musicians were encouraged to use the space for innovative, small-scale productions, thus providing an outlet for ground-breaking Australian theatre and fostering writers like David Williamson, Jack Hibberd and Tes Lyssiotis. One of the inaugural appointees to the Australia Council, Burstall was named a Member of the Order of Australia in 1993 for her contribution to the performing arts.

In 1941 he published The Production of Antibodies. Together with Frank Fenner, he produced a substantially revised version of this book in 1949. Broadly, it contained the discoveries for which Burnet was to win the Nobel Prize in 1960. Burnet worked for most of his career at the University of Melbourne's Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, of which he was Assistant Director from 1928 to 1931 and Director from 1944 to 1965. His successor, Sir Gustav Nossal, described Burnet as 'truly a lateral thinker, but a highly disciplined one'.

The portrait shows Burnet investigating influenza virus, which was his major interest between 1940 and 1957. In the 1930s Burnet made what was probably the most noteworthy technical advance in microbiology by an Australian. This was the use of chick embryos (instead of expensive and inconvenient numbers of rabbits or mice) for the isolation and assay of animal viruses. By creating a large artificial airspace between the membrane around the embryo and the eggshell, he could inoculate the egg with measured amounts of viral material and count the 'pocks' that grew on the membrane. This is what he is about to do to the egg on the stand in the picture, using material taken from one of the test tubes in the wooden stand. Over sixty years later one of these procedures is still used for producing influenza vaccine.

His first major series of paintings, collectively titled Images of Modern Evil, was painted between 1945 and 1947. Throughout the 1950s Tucker lived in Europe and the United States, where he refined and extended his subjects, concentrating on Australian myths, which he saw as central to the definition of national identity.

Joy Hester (1920-1960) was the only female member of the group of artists known as the Angry Penguins, which included Tucker, Sidney Nolan and Arthur Boyd. During her lifetime Hester's contribution was overshadowed by those of her male contemporaries, but her work is now widely acknowledged, especially her drawings, which are characterised by intense imagery and ability to convey states of mind and emotions. Hester's life was beset by sadness.

Along with his fellow Meriam people, Mabo was convinced that he owned his family's land on Murray Island (Mer) in Torres Strait. By contrast, Queensland Crown lawyers argued that on annexation in 1879, all the land had become the property of the Crown. In 1992, the seven Justices of the High Court found 6-1 in favour of Mabo and his co-plaintiffs, overturning the accepted view that Australia had been terra nullius (empty land) before white settlement. Mabo died before the historic decision, which was to lead to the Land Title Act of 1993, and permanently to alter the way Australians think about Aboriginal land ownership. Gordon Bennett (1955-2014) grew up in Nambour, Queensland and only learned of his mother's Indigenous heritage in his early teens. He went to art school as a mature student. Stating early in his career that 'the bottom line of my work is coming to terms with my Aboriginality,' he continued to engage with questions of cultural and personal identity, interrogating Australia's colonial past and postcolonial present through a succession of allusive postmodern works. He won the John McCaughey Memorial Art Prize of the National Gallery of Victoria in 1997, and the NGV mounted a touring exhibition, Gordon Bennett, in 2007-08. Bennett said that when he began to think about Eddie Mabo he 'could not think of him as a real person ... I only [knew] the Eddie Mabo of the mainstream news media, a very two-dimensional copy of the man himself.' So, in making his portrait of Mabo, he used a newspaper image and headlines from newspaper articles about the Native Title furore, and combined them with an image by the American artist Mike Kelley, in which a black man is hauled by the neck towards enlightenment. 'To me the image of Eddie Mabo stood like the eye of a storm,' he said, 'calmly asserting his rights while all around him the storm, a war of words and rhetoric, raged.' After Bennett's death his friend, artist Richard Bell, wrote: 'Though he was raised white, everytime Gordon looked in the mirror he saw traces of his Aboriginal past ... he saw the attempted erasure - genetically, physically historically - of a people.'

'That was an unusual decision for anyone in Australia, boy or girl', she recalls. She married businessman Leon Fink in 1961, placing her creative ambitions on hold while raising her three children. In 1971, she saw a production of David Williamson's The Removalists in Kings Cross and decided to make a film of it, despite having very little training or experience in film. With a cast including Jacki Weaver, Kate Fitzpatrick, and Chris Haywood, The Removalists appeared in 1975. The film established Fink as a 'hands-on' producer who worked closely with her director. Her collaboration with young director, Gillian Armstrong, on My Brilliant Career (1979) launched the careers of both Armstrong and its lead actor, Judy Davis. The film won Best Picture at the Australian Film Institute (AFI) Awards in 1979. Fink also produced For Love Alone (1986), based on the novel by Christina Stead, and the well-received television series Edens Lost (1988) which in 1989 won an AFI Award and a Penguin Award.

While still a student, she exhibited with the Society of Artists in Sydney and had examples of her work purchased by the state galleries of New South Wales and South Australia.

Heysen stated in 1994: 'I wanted at that time to get away from my father's subject matter. I turned to painting faces and painting myself... to get right away' and to establish a sense of independence as an artist. She went to London in 1934, studying at the Central School of Art and the Byam Shaw School before returning to Australia.

At a time when radio stations were reluctant to promote local talent, O'Keefe was the first Australian rock performer to score a chart hit with the 1958 song 'Wild One', paving the way to success for other Australian musicians. A raw, energetic and exuberant performer, O'Keefe recorded 30 chart hits, but his signature tune remained Shout, containing the oft-repeated words 'a little bit louder now'.  In 1959 he presided over the television show Six O'Clock Rock and he was later host of The Johnny O'Keefe Show. Despite his success, the Wild One's personal life was tumultuous. He suffered periods of depression, was prone to violent outbursts, and in 1960 his face required extensive reconstruction after a near-fatal car crash. Drug abuse, drinking and overwork contributed to his death from a heart attack at the age of 43.    Ivan Durrant was about thirteen years old when he first saw O'Keefe on television.  At the time Durrant had a 'rocker' hairdo and fancied that he resembled O'Keefe.

Soon after his arrival, he set out on a series of journeys undertaken to select land for the South Australian Company, taking in the Murray Lakes, the Mount Lofty Ranges, the Fleurieu Peninsula, the Barossa Valley and other parts of the south-east of the colony before embarking on a trip to New Zealand of several months' duration. In South Australia again from early 1845, he accompanied Governor Sir George Grey on journeys to Port Lincoln and Kangaroo Island, adding to his already substantial portfolio of drawings. He exhibited these in Adelaide in June 1845 - South Australia's first art exhibition - and then left for Sydney, showing his work there also before departing for home.

His volumes South Australia Illustrated, The New Zealanders Illustrated and Savage Life and Scenes in Australia and New Zealand appeared in 1847; and in 1848, following an exhibition of works he created during a trip to South Africa, The Kaffirs Illustrated was published. Angas returned to Australia in 1850 with his wife, Maria, initially setting up a studio in Adelaide, but then trying his luck on the diggings in New South Wales and Victoria. From 1853 until 1860, Angas worked at the Australian Museum, undertaking cataloguing and research. After three years back in South Australia, Angas returned to England but continued to produce publications drawn from his antipodean experiences, among them Australia: A Popular Account of its Physical Features, Inhabitants, Natural History and Productions, With the History of its Colonization (1865).

She endowed the Murdoch Children's Research Unit, the Dame Elisabeth Murdoch Sculpture Foundation, the Dame Elisabeth Murdoch Arboretum, and the Australian Ballet.

On the first of his three voyages of discovery in the Pacific he made meticulous charts of the bays, rivers and islands he passed, and a great number of places in eastern Australia are still known by the names he gave them that fateful autumn and winter. Before the Endeavour sailed away, he took possession of the entire east coast, which he named New South Wales, in the name of His Majesty, King George the Third. Cook was almost continually at sea between 1768 and 1779, scrutinising vast areas that had previously been only tentatively investigated, and charting them with extraordinary accuracy. Accounts produced from his voyages provided Europeans with their first glimpse of the culture, wildlife and geography of lands as diverse as Tahiti and Alaska, and as a result of measures he took to raise standards of hygiene and nutrition on board his ships, there was an appreciable improvement in the health of future British seamen. Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay, Hawaii, on 14 February 1779, after having left and then returned to make essential repairs. This is one of three surviving portraits of Cook by John Webber RA (c. 1752-1793). London-born Webber was apprenticed in 1767 to the Swiss landscape artist Johann Aberli, with whom he spent three years before continuing his studies in Paris. He returned to London at 24, and was admitted to study at the Royal Academy, where he first exhibited in 1776. Daniel Solander, the Swedish naturalist who sailed on the Endeavour with Cook and Banks, admired Webber's works at this first exhibition. Knowing that no official artist had been appointed for Cook's imminent voyage, he recommended Webber. It was Webber's job to make drawings and paintings of people and objects encountered on the voyage of the Resolution; to 'observe the genius, temper, disposition of the natives... showing them every kind of civility and regard'. On this voyage first European contact was established with Hawaiian and British Columbian Indigenous people, and the Resolution's crew were amongst the first Europeans to meet the original inhabitants of Alaska and Kamchatka. The illustrations Webber made were included in the three- volume official record of the voyage, and boosted its commercial success. In London, Webber was often visited by people keen to hear tales of the tragic journey and to see his drawings and curiosities. He exhibited works relating to the expedition at the Royal Academy, and made a modest income from reworking drawings for sale. In his posthumous portrait of Cook, Webber depicted him in the glove he customarily wore to conceal the scars from an injury he sustained in North America in 1764, when a horn of powder he was holding exploded.

Many of the short pieces, essays and journalism collected in (and so forth) (2000) were inspired by paintings.  In Twilight of Love: Travels with Turgenev (2005), a mixture of biography, memoir and travel narrative, Dessaix returned to themes of Turgenev: the quest for faith, the literary critical treatise that he had written some twenty-five years earlier.

Much in demand as an official portraitist, he painted the Historic Memorials Committee's official prime-ministerial portrait of Paul Keating.   Hannaford approached Dessaix about painting his portrait after having sketched him sleeping, while sitting next to him on a plane. In the first stages Dessaix was amazed to see himself in just 'a few strokes of black' that Hannaford had made; 'there were no eyes, there was no mouth, there were just a few sketch lines on white canvas, and it was me'.  As the portrait progressed, the artist literally running to different vantage points in the room and back again to the canvas, holding mirrors at odd angles, coming in close to the author to stare silently at his features, Dessaix began to feel that at some level he was trying to maintain possession of something indefinable that Hannaford was 'trying to take hold of'.  In the end, while he found the finished portrait beautiful as a work of art, he felt that Hannaford had rendered him 'more haggard' than he himself thought he looked, imbuing his face with 'a sort of sadness'.

The single 'Boys in Town', performed in the film, became a top ten hit, and Amphlett was nominated for an AFI Award as Best Supporting Actress. A critically acclaimed first full-length album, Desperate (1983), followed. Over the next decade, with a number of personnel changes, the band became part of the international Australian music assault that included Midnight Oil, INXS and Crowded House.

These have included movie star portraits, 'propaganda' images of his wife and daughter, a horse racing series, and more recently, paintings of wool sheds.

He arrived back in Melbourne in 1885 and established a successful portrait practice. At the same time, he began to paint outdoors with a number of other artists, including Charles Conder and Arthur Streeton, and together they came to be known as the Heidelberg School. Roberts himself gained a reputation as the 'father of Australian landscape painting', although his works include many superb representations of men and women from late-nineteenth- century artistic, musical and political circles. In 1901 Roberts won the contract to paint the opening of the first Federal Parliament in Melbourne. At forty- seven, the artist hoped that the 5x3 metre painting would establish his reputation in England, where, over two and a half years, he completed its accurate likenesses of 269 people, painting 'against time and light and fog', as he put it. He found, however, that 'England doesn't really want anybody. She has everybody and everything. The supply is in excess of the demand ... everyone comes here sooner or later. The only thing is to make her want you, and that is difficult, for she really only wants the exceptional in any line.' The big picture was presented by the Commonwealth to King Edward VII, who insisted on its being hung at the Royal Academy. In 1958 HM Queen Elizabeth II loaned the work permanently to Australia; it hangs in Parliament House. After many fairly miserable years in London, where he was supported by his wife, Lillie, a framemaker, Roberts returned to the Dandenongs, where he mainly painted landscapes and flower pieces.

He has published some thirty books, dedicated to 'the glory of God' and linked by their engagement with the values of what he calls the 'real Australia' - the rural heartland and the bush.  In 1998 the Federal Government commissioned Murray to write a new preamble to the Constitution, but the government rejected much of the draft and he later dissociated himself from the project.   David Naseby worked for a time in advertising, and one of his first portrait commissions was of Belinda Green for John Singleton. He was a finalist in the Archibald Prizes of 1995, 1998 and 1999 for his portraits of Les Murray (twice) and Bob Ellis. Segments of the documentary film Bastards From the Bush, featuring Murray and Ellis, were filmed in Naseby's studio while he painted the second portrait of Murray. To make this portrait David Naseby and his wife travelled to Murray's home property in Bunyah and stayed there for the weekend. The artist was struck by Murray's air of strange simplicity.

The Brisbane-born artist developed his technique with pen and ink drawings of the city before moving to Sydney in 1917 to work in a commercial art studio.  In the early 1930s he concentrated solely on drawing, particularly the rocky landscapes around Sydney, but by the late 1930s he began painting in an increasingly romantic manner. He remained actively painting and drawing until his death in Hobart at the age of 93. Rees taught art history at the University of Sydney for a number of years, and was a favourite with students.  Rod Shaw knew and admired Rees and has depicted him here in heroic guise.  The work refers to Rees's trip to Central Australia in the mid-1970s, which resulted in his masterly series of paintings of Uluru and Kata Tjuta (The Olgas).      Roderick Shaw studied art at East Sydney Technical College, and worked during the war at the Commonwealth Aircraft factory, painting camouflage alongside William Dobell and Joshua Smith.  After the war he worked as a designer and illustrator, and was also a printer of quality books, producing volumes of poems by A.D. Hope and David Campbell, among others. Shaw and Dick Edwards together established The Barn on the Hill press in 1939.  They were later instrumental in ending the censorship of four letter words in Australia by publishing the banned report of the trial of Penguin books over Lady Chatterley's Lover.  Shaw designed the mural for the Waterside Workers' Federation Office, and has become best known for his worker paintings of the social realist school, such as Cable Layers, owned by the Art Gallery of NSW.  For many years he taught at workshops and summer schools, and he was a foundation member of Artists for Democracy and of Artists Against Nuclear War.

Later, Williamson based himself in Sydney, recalling his Melbourne experiences as unhappy. From the outset, Williamson aimed to 'get our own stories on stage, spoken in our own accents, reflecting our own life'.

Chisholm claimed to be as young as seven when she first became interested in welfare work and gained her first experience of it having accompanied her husband, Archibald Chisholm, to India in 1833. Concerned at the lack of provision made for the daughters of British soldiers there, Chisholm opened a school offering instruction in subjects such as reading, writing and 'domestic management'. After five years in India, Chisholm, with her husband and two sons, left for New South Wales. On arriving in Sydney in July 1838, Chisholm was shocked by the conditions faced by single women immigrants and resolved 'never to rest until decent protection was afforded them'. She began by taking newly-arrived women into her own home and in 1841 she opened the Female Immigrants' Home, which provided shelter and operated as an employment agency. Despite official indifference and squatters' hostility to her plans, she led convoys of horse-drawn vehicles into rural areas, settling people on farms. By 1842, as she claimed in her publication Female Immigration, Considered in a Brief Account of the Sydney Immigrants' Home, she had helped 'upwards of 2,000 persons' find homes, husbands and employment. In 1846, she returned to England, but continued her campaigns: giving evidence on colonisation in the House of Lords, lobbying for government-assisted emigration by respectable families, including those of emancipated convicts; and, in 1849, founding the Family Colonisation Loan Society. In some cases she personally supervised the embarkation of passengers on ships bound for Australia. By the early 1850s she was one of the best-known women in England and pictures of her sold in great numbers; each day she dealt with more than a hundred letters from prospective emigrants. Following up on her publication promising the availability in the colony of Meat Three Times a Day!! (1847) she published The A.B.C. of Colonisation (1850) and The Emigrant's Guide to Australia (1853).

The possibility of using an electrical device to stimulate the nerves inside the inner ear to produce hearing had been pursued sporadically by researchers since the eighteenth century. He has said that he discovered how to insert an electrode into the inner ear while toying with a shell and a blade of grass on the beach. It took him and his team twelve years to develop the first device that could infiltrate an ear successfully. Nicknamed the 'Bionic Ear', it remains the world leader in its field. Refinement of the cochlear implant continues, and lessons learned in its development are now being applied in research into the treatment of neurological and psychiatric conditions, blindness and injury-induced paralysis. Currently Distinguished Researcher at ICT for Life Sciences, a combined life science, physical science, engineering and information and communication technology centre at the University of Melbourne, Clark has six honorary degrees and won the prestigious Lasker prize for science in 2013.

She was the first female member of the Australian Workers' Union, and from 1908 to 1931 she championed the causes of the underprivileged as editor of the women's page of the Australian Worker. In 1930 she published The Wild Swan, a book of verse decrying white settlers' ravaging of the land and indifference to Aboriginal culture. Under the Wilgas (1932) and subsequent works expanded on this theme. Between 1891 and 1961 at least 13 portraits were made of Gilmore by various artists. (Before its acquisition by the National Portrait Gallery, this was the only known portrait of Gilmore in a private collection.) In 1937, when she was made a Dame of the British Empire in recognition of her contribution to Australian life and literature, she became the first person to be created DBE for writing. Her State funeral in Sydney was the first for an Australian writer since that of her friend Henry Lawson, forty years earlier. Gordon Lyall Trindall (1886-1965) gave up his Marrickville barbering business at the age of twenty-six to become an artist. He undertook some training at the JS Watkins School, and won the one and only Fairfax Prize in 1914. By the 1940s he was widely known for his portraits and nudes, which commanded extraordinarily high prices. Trindall stated that while modern art may be good, he himself could not make a living at it. Instead, his aim was to paint what the public wanted;'sincerity', he said, 'is my guiding principle'. In 1951 he took out a writ for \u00a3735 against the McCaugheys of Narrandera and Darling Point, having painted a portrait of Mrs McCaughey that she 'repudiated' when she saw it. He claimed that the couple had commissioned the portrait, while she maintained that she had 'allowed' him to paint her for the Archibald.

Usually driving Holdens, he went on to win the Bathurst Enduro race nine times, the Sandown Endurance race nine times and the Australian Touring Car Championship three times. In 1997 the 'King of the Mountain' became the oldest driver to win a round of the Touring Car Championship. After retiring, Brock continued to race miscellaneous vehicles while developing the philanthropic Peter Brock Foundation and working with GreenFleet, encouraging investment in forests. Dubbed 'Peter Perfect' for his superb appearance as much as for his driving record, the gregarious hero was widely mourned after he died in a rally accident in Western Australia in September 2006. Julie Edgar (b. 1951) is a Melbourne artist. A motor sport enthusiast, she chose to sculpt Brock because she admired his achievements and his 'ability to inspire people from all walks of life'. Brock insisted that Edgar should portray him as he appeared at the time of their one and only sitting. The artist broadly complied, but admits to 'just a hint of idealisation' in his classical features and burning gaze. She infused the sculpture with a 'heroic aspect', which she reinforced with the asymmetrical placement of the racing suit collar and the angle of the head.

When she was eleven years old, her father died, leaving the running of the 32000-acre property to her mother. The financial difficulties occasioned by a prolonged period of drought at Coorain eventually saw the family relocate to Sydney, Ker Conway completing her school education at Abbotsleigh. It was there, Ker Conway has said, that she first encountered the idea that 'women could achieve'. She then studied at the University of Sydney, graduating in 1958 with the University Medal for history. Despite her success, she was unhappy with the direction of Australian scholarship, and her own job prospects in this country in the 1950s were minimal. Turned down (on the basis of gender) for a post with the Commonwealth Department of External Affairs, she applied to study at Harvard University, leaving Australia in 1960. She completed her PhD at Harvard in 1969. By then married to Canadian history professor, John Conway, she taught at the University of Toronto for eleven years and in 1975 became the first woman appointed President of Smith College, Massachusetts, the largest women's college in the United States. She has edited a number of anthologies of women's life writing; and written several books on the historical experience of American women as well as three volumes of autobiography: The Road From Coorain (1989); True North (1994); and A woman's education (2001). In July 2013, she was awarded the USA's National Humanities Medal by President Barack Obama, having a month previously been named an honorary Companion of the Order of Australia.

She met Jill Ker Conway in 1984, when she was commissioned by Smith College to paint Ker Conway's official presidential portrait. During the sittings the pair became good friends, prompting the artist to create another portrait capturing the informal aspects of Ker Conway's personality.

Born in Lancashire and raised in Manchester, Mort emigrated to New South Wales in 1838, believing that the colony presented 'a better opening for his industrious habits and his business abilities than there was in the land of his birth'. Within five years he had started his own business as an auctioneer of wool and other commodities - a profession for which his 'suavity of demeanour, and imperturbable good temper, rendered him eminently fit'. By 1850, he was the premier auctioneer in Sydney and had interests in insurance, agriculture, railway and mining ventures, among others. But he is perhaps most remembered for other initiatives, such as the dairy farms he operated on the estate he acquired at Bodalla in 1860; and the dry dock he helped to establish at Balmain in 1855, which he progressed from shipbuilding to locomotive production and general engineering. He also funded experiments in freezing and refrigeration technology, forming the New South Wales Fresh Food and Ice Company in 1875. Mort donated some of his substantial wealth to community causes, contributing to the building of Sydney's St Andrew's Cathedral and the University's St Paul's College. Following his death in May 1878, the city marked its esteem for him with a statue in Macquarie Place and Balmain's Mort Bay was named in his honour.

The eldest of eight children, she was educated at home and received art lessons from Conrad Martens and the ex-convict portraitist, Charles Rodius. Theresa was around twenty-one when she married Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, and twenty-three when her first child, James Laidley Mort, was born. Theresa had eight more children over the next seventeen years; seven of them survived to adulthood. She spent much of her married life at Greenoaks, the Darling Point home established by Mort in 1843.

In August 1966 he led a walkout of Aboriginal stockmen and their families who were employed in unsafe and inequitable conditions on Wave Hill cattle station, south-west of Katherine. Over time, a land rights claim evolved. A 1967 petition by Lingiari and his people was rejected. However, the Whitlam Government, elected in 1972, negotiated a land claim between the traditional owners and the British pastoral company Vestey Ltd. Two new leases were issued; the Gurindji acquired title to 3 250 square kilometres, including the most sacred areas of traditional lands. The Hon. Edward Gough Whitlam AC QC (1916-2014) was prime minister of Australia from the end of 1972 - when he became the first Labor prime minister since 1949 - to the end of 1975, when he was controversially dismissed. Whitlam's election ushered in an ambitious range of new government policy on issues as various as conscription, relations with South Africa and China, free tertiary education, welfare, capital punishment, enfranchisement and Aboriginal land rights.   Mervyn Bishop (b.1945) has been employed as a photographer for the Sydney Morning Herald and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and has worked freelance, often for Aboriginal organisations, since 1986.

Bishop was present when Gough Whitlam gave up the deeds to the traditional lands in a shed at Daguragu (Wattie Creek), Northern Territory in August 1975 and persuaded the protagonists to repeat the transaction in the open air. Nugget Coombs had suggested to Whitlam that he should pour soil into the hand of Vincent Lingiari as he handed over the deeds to the Gurindji - a reversal of the gesture between John Batman and the Wurundjeri as the 'rights' to the land now occupied by Melbourne were exchanged in 1835.

The youngest of six children, Fulton was three years old when her family emigrated to Australia from Scotland and settled in Glen Innes, New South Wales. She began giving cooking demonstrations while working for the Australian Gas Light Company during the war, also conducting a series of cookery lessons for the Blind Society. After a short-lived marriage, she completed a cooking course at East Sydney Tech and began writing cookery pages in women's magazines in the early 1950s. As cookery editor of Woman's Day, Fulton travelled overseas and called on the consequent culinary experiences in writing the first of her many books, The Margaret Fulton Cookbook. First published in 1968, it is considered revolutionary for having enabled Australian cooks to add international dishes and ideas to their everyday repertoires. In 1999 she published I Sang for My Supper, a book documenting her life and the changing social and cultural scene in Australia from the 1920s to the present. Fulton was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1983, was declared a Living National Treasure in 1997, and in 2009 was judged by the Good Weekend to be one of Australia's twenty-five most influential people. The Margaret Fulton Cookbook, a revised edition of which was published in 2010, has sold more than 1.5 million copies and remains a staple in many kitchens around the country.

In 1971, partly encouraged by his friend, designer and cookery writer, Babette Hayes, he moved to Australia. Subsequently he produced photographs for various lifestyle, design, cookery and decorating publications.

Discharged from the Air Force on medical grounds in 1945, Grainer studied under Eugene Goossens at Sydney's Conservatorium of Music before moving to London in the early sixties and becoming a rehearsal pianist for the BBC.

He encouraged her to abandon the heavier vocal roles she favoured and to become a coloratura soprano; the transformation was key to her success.

Born in Sydney, Hughes was educated at Riverview and Sydney University, although he did not complete a degree.  Like many of the figures who floated around the Sydney 'Push' in the late 1950s, he began his career contributing poems, cartoons, criticism and articles to Honi Soit, the Observer, and Nation.  He began working for Time in 1970, the year his The Art of Australia was published, and lived in the USA for the rest of his life.  His books and television series include The Shock of the New (1980), The Fatal Shore (1987), Nothing if Not Critical (1990),  American Visions (1997) and A Jerk on One End (1999), the latter about fishing. In 1999, just after beginning to film his television series on Australia Beyond the Fatal Shore, Hughes suffered a terrible car accident on the coast of Western Australia. The series was cobbled together during his agonising convalescence, and Hughes had little control over the final cut; it was hostilely reviewed. The accident led to a protracted legal process; three years later, there was still talk of extraditing Hughes from the USA to face charges.  His second marriage broke down, and his only son died. The effect of these experiences on his friend led Leak to abandon his earlier, more detailed portrait for this one, inspired by the terrifying late work of Goya, conveying Hughes's furious pain, despair and determination in the years after 1999. Named the London Sunday Times Writer of the Year in 2000, Hughes proceeded to write Goya (2003) and a superb autobiography, Things I Didn't Know (2006).

Partly inspired by the British punk rock explosion, McLennan and Forster nonetheless attempted a blend of Dylan-like lyrics and Monkees-style simplicity, which soon flowered into a melancholy melodiousness and genuine poetic lyricism.  With Lindy Morrison on drums they recorded six albums including Before Hollywood (1983), Liberty Belle and the Black Diamond Express (1986) and Tallulah (1987).  From 1979 the band was based in the UK, where they achieved rapturous critical acclaim but scant commercial success; they split in 1989. In 1997, when they reunited for a series of showcase gigs in the UK, London's Sunday Times critic described The Go-Betweens' output as 'six of the greatest albums of all time'.  After re-forming the band they released three albums. Oceans Apart (2005) earned the Go Betweens their first ARIA, for Best Adult Contemporary Album of 2005.   Melbourne artist Jenny Watson taught in various art institutions through the 1970s and 80s, and Nick Cave was briefly a student of hers at the Caulfield Institute of Technology. She attended some early performances of The Boys Next Door, and went on to witness the development of the Melbourne punk scene centred around the Tiger Lounge in Richmond and the Crystal Ballroom in St Kilda. The Crystal Ballroom, Watson has said, was the place 'where both the best art and the best music were happening - known only to a minute audience with no power, no money and no influence.  But . . . all of the references go back to those places.' In 1977 she made a series of portraits of the Boys Next Door, and a number of self-portraits playing around the theme of the Tiger Lounge. Four years later she painted these three portraits of The Go-Betweens for the cover of the band's first album, Send Me a Lullaby.

Born in Melbourne, educated in Canberra and Sydney, he was admitted to the New South Wales Bar after war service.  He won the Federal seat of Werriwa in 1952, was deputy leader of the ALP from 1960 to 1967, and was then its leader until the end of 1977, a record term for the party. In 1972 he became the first Labor Prime Minister since 1949. During his term in office he abolished conscription; cut ties with South Africa; negotiated diplomatic relations with China; began inquiries into Aboriginal land rights; abolished fees for tertiary education; established the Schools Commission; introduced welfare payments for single-parent families and homeless people; ended the death penalty for Federal crimes; and reduced the voting age to 18.  Whitlam's term came to an abrupt end on 11 November 1975.  In the preceding eighteen months the government had been shaken by a series of scandals, resignations, sackings and ministerial reshuffles. In October 1975 the Opposition, led by Malcolm Fraser, used the Liberal majority in the Senate to block the supply of funds essential to the operation of the government.  Aiming to force Whitlam to an early election, he justified his action on the grounds that the 'incompetence, the damage, the failures of the worst government in our history cannot be ignored'.  Whitlam, in turn, declared that it was unconstitutional for the Senate to attempt to determine who should hold government.  The deadlock continued for several weeks, with the government's money fast running out.  On 11 November the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, having consulted the Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Garfield Barwick, dismissed Gough Whitlam and appointed Malcolm Fraser Caretaker Prime Minister.  Whitlam called on the people to maintain their rage at Kerr's unprecedented act.  However, at the election held on 13 December 1975, Fraser's Liberal / National Country Party Coalition won office by the biggest majority since Federation. ", "title": "The Hon E.G.

First exhibiting with Roland Wakelin and Grace Cossington Smith in Sydney in 1916, he became fascinated by the relationship between music and colour, and in 1919 he painted some of the earliest purely abstract art in the world.  After some years travelling back and forth between Europe and Australia, in 1930 he settled in London, where he modified his name, concocted a new identity and lived until his death.  He was very close to Patrick White, who became a major collector of his work, and Francis Bacon, who was significantly influenced by his style.  After several exhibitions in England and a conversion to Catholicism he was commissioned to paint the Stations of the Cross for Westminster Cathedral.  He is represented in all major Australian galleries, and the Tate Gallery in London.  Jean Shepeard was an actress and artist who trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.  While sharing a flat with Peggy Ashcroft, she became a member of the Emotionist group of painters, musicians, philosophers, poets and actors. This drawing was probably included in a 1930 exhibition of works by Shepeard, Roi de Mestre and Francis Bacon in Bacon's Queensbury Mews rooms, then described as a 'studio for modern interior decoration'.  Contemporary reviewers praised various qualities in her sensitive drawings of heads, while Bacon's and de Mestre's paintings were thought to be mainly intended as ambient decor.  Shepeard continued to exhibit her art while performing in major theatres alongside John Gielgud, Anthony Quayle, Sybil Thorndike and many other leading actors, and progressing to a moderately successful film career. Her other drawing subjects included Francis Bacon, JB Priestly, Peggy Ashcroft and Vanessa Bell.

Awarded a British Council Scholarship in 1950, he moved to London, subsequently working there and in Australia over the next four decades on more than 140 ballet, opera and theatre productions. In the 1960s, he developed a close association with the Australian Ballet, creating designs for productions including Coppelia (1960), Giselle (1965) and Sleeping Beauty (1973), the latter being the first production performed by the company at the Sydney Opera House. In the 1970s, he created the sets and costumes for the ballets of Peter Sculthorpe's Sun Music and Rites of Passage, choreographed by Robert Helpmann. At the same time, Rowell developed a considerable reputation as an artist, producing expressionist paintings, mixed media works and sculpture inspired by the Australian landscape.

The team was led by Wollongong-born David Gregory (1845-1919), who had captained a combined New South Wales and Victoria team in its defeat of a touring English side in March 1877. Afterwards, in partnership with a Victorian named John Conway (1842-1909), Gregory put together a side to play a series of matches in England. Recruited were New South Welshmen Frederick Spofforth (1853-1926), William (Billy) Murdoch (1854-1911), Thomas Garrett (1858-1943), Charles Bannerman (1851-1930), and his brother, Alec (1854- 1924); Victorians Francis (Frank) Allan (1849-1917), Thomas Horan (1854-1916), John McCarthy (Jack) Blackham (1854-1932) and Henry Boyle (1847-1907); and a Tasmanian, George Bailey (1853-1926). Another player, Billy Midwinter (1851-1890), joined the team in England but defected halfway through the tour to play for Gloucestershire. The players and their two managers (Conway and William Gibbes) contributed \u00a350 each to finance the tour, playing a number of warm-up matches against local teams before leaving for England in March 1878. They defeated a Marylebone Cricket Club eleven (captained by WG Grace) by nine wickets at Lord's in May 1878, bowling them out for 33 and 19, with Australian fast bowler Spofforth -  aka 'The Demon' -  taking six wickets for four runs in the first innings and four for sixteen in the second. Then, between June and September, the team played games against Middlesex, Surrey and Gloucestershire (Spofforth again being the main destroyer); and en route home stopped in America for fixtures in Philadelphia and San Francisco. A crowd of 20,000 people is said to have welcomed them back to Sydney at the conclusion of the tour, which had proved an enormous financial as well as sporting success.

He and his brother Elcon adopted the name Myer and worked briefly at a drapery store in Flinders Lane before moving to Bendigo, where they opened the first Myer store in 1900. The venture prospered, and they opened a second store in 1908. In 1911 Sidney Myer bought a drapery concern in Bourke Street, Melbourne, along with a number of neighbouring properties. On this site he built a department store called the Myer Emporium, which introduced to Australia the bargain basement, the self-service cafeteria, motorised home deliveries, and other advanced selling techniques based on Myer's observations on frequent trips to the US and Europe. The business expanded to Adelaide and later across Australia. In 1920 he married Merlyn Baillieu, the daughter of an established Queenscliff family. Through the Depression Myer continued to expand and Sidney Myer made generous contributions to cultural and charitable causes, making funds available, for example, to provide work for unemployed married men on the Yarra Boulevard. Myer's sons Kenneth Baillieu (who died in 1992) and Sidney Baillieu maintained the family's tradition of philanthropic generosity and members of the Myer family remain prominent contributors to Melbourne's civic and cultural life. Paul Montford (1868-1938) came to Australia from England in 1921, attracted by the light, which he believed to be conducive to monumental sculpture. Settling in Melbourne, he soon created controversy with his avant-garde opinions about the social and environmental role of threedimensional art. A zestful worker, he is credited with fostering the proliferation of public sculpture in Australia.

After World War 1 he opened his first 'nothing over 2/6-' store in Collingwood. Over the course of the twentieth century, as the firm went on to acquire many other retail chains, George Coles and four of his brothers worked up through the company to become directors.

In the latter role, he was credited with making the annual showcase for music, dance, theatre, art exhibitions and outdoor events more diverse, accessible and financially viable. From 1996 to 2000 he was the inaugural chairman of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra; in 2001 he directed the Olympic Arts Festival; and in 2002-2003 he directed the Sydney New Year's Eve celebrations. He has been a lively media commentator on museums and heritage issues, and during his long tenancy at Sydney's historic Bronte House he painstakingly restored and maintained the house and its grounds. His book The Garden at Bronte (2002) is an Australian horticultural classic. Having revivified a historic house in the town of Kempton, north of Hobart, from 2005, Schofield returned to Sydney to continue work as an arts administrator, staging major events there, in Hobart and in Brisbane. Schofield donated beguiling miniatures of Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis and his wife Elizabeth to the National Portrait Gallery in 2002, and served on the Gallery's advisory board. Brent Harris (b. 1956) is a Melbourne-based painter and printmaker best known for his distinctive brand of geometric abstraction. In some of Harris's abstract work, inaugural National Portrait Gallery Director Andrew Sayers noticed circular forms that were faintly suggestive of portraiture. Leo Schofield's long and diverse involvement in the arts led Sayers to believe that he would embrace the idea of sitting to a painter working completely outside his usual practice. Having been persuaded to undertake the commission, which came as a considerable surprise, Harris finished two different paintings of Schofield, and invited the Gallery to choose between them. In one, Schofield was pictured under a flowering wisteria, reflecting his passion for old gardens. In the other - the work chosen - the oval frame around Schofield's sparely rendered, yet unmistakable face seemed to reflect his interest in colonial art. Brent Harris said that his first portrait would probably be his last; later he completed a starkly gentle series depicting the face of Christ.

Cossington Smith began her training art in 1910 with the Italian born teacher, Antonio Dattilo Rubbo, who she later described as 'the only one in Sydney at that time who knew anything about the modern masters'. Her parents, Ernest and Grace Smith, supported her pursuit of art, enabling her to spend two years overseas during which period she studied in England. She returned to Rubbo's classes in Sydney in 1914 and the following year her painting The sock knitter was included in the Royal Art Society exhibition. The painting is considered the first post-impressionist work painted in Australia. Around 1920, she adopted the surname Cossington-Smith, 'Cossington' being the name of the family home in Turramurra where Grace lived and worked for almost sixty-five years. Despite the hostility of the conservative Sydney art  establishment,  Cossington Smith became one of a group of artists who stayed resolute in their exploration of modernism. In the late 1920s, she began exhibiting with the Contemporary Group and held the first of many solo exhibitions; and in the same period commenced work on her exhilarating and now celebrated series of paintings of the Sydney Harbour Bridge under construction. Following the deaths of her parents in the 1930s, Cossington Smith moved from her garden studio to one attached to the main house and during the 1940s began to focus on intimate paintings of interiors, in which she tried to express forms with colour and light. Her contribution to Australian art went largely unrecognised until, at age eighty-one, she was honoured with a retrospective exhibition, which opened at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in June 1973 and toured to State galleries. She was awarded an OBE the same year. She eventually left Cossington and moved to a nursing home, where she died at the age of ninety-two in December 1984. Her works have since become among those most recognised in the collections of major galleries and in the canon of modern art in Australia.

Born on Napperby Station near Alice Springs, he gained a reputation as a woodcarver while working as a stockman, developing an extensive knowledge of the Dreaming trails and sites that crisscross the McDonnell Ranges. From 1976 he expressed his experience in a series of large 'map paintings' portraying these trails as  deeds of title to his ancestral land. At this time, he became chairman of the Papunya Tula artists. Following a large retrospective of his work at London's Institute for Contemporary Arts in 1988, he held a solo exhibition at the Rebecca Hossack Gallery in London in 1990. In the last years of his life, during which he divided his time between Alice Springs, Sydney, the US and Europe, Tjapaltjarri was widely acknowledged as one of Australia's great painters. Tim Johnson (b. 1947) is a Sydney based painter, sculptor, teacher and filmmaker. In the 1960s and 1970s he built his reputation on conceptual works, performance happenings, pictures and films of bands, and films on conceptual art. He first visited the Papunya Tula settlement in the late 1970s, documenting, collecting and promoting its art, which was then still little known. Watching the artists at work brought him back to painting; he painted the painters painting, as he had painted cult band Radio Birdman performing. Soon he started using dots in his own work. In the 1986 Biennale of Sydney an allusionlaced dotted painting by Johnson hung alongside the work of Papunya Tula artist Michael Jagamara Nelson, who along with Clifford Possum was one of Johnson's major collaborators in the 1980s. Scholar Vivien Johnson, who has written extensively on both Clifford Possum and Tim Johnson, points out that although he was initially suspected of appropriation of Indigenous culture, Johnson kept dotting long after the Aboriginal artists with whom he had worked stopped. 'After twenty years he has become something of a virtuoso, with his own individual style', she writes. 'His imagery ranges from Tibetan Buddhism to extra-terrestrials, but the lyrically beautiful dotted fields in which it is set testify to Johnson's enduring love affair with Papunya painting'.

From 1987, when she was named Young Australian of the Year, she was based overseas, where she worked with the Cologne Opera before joining the Berlin State Opera. She was the first woman to conduct at the Vienna State Opera and at the Bastille in Paris; engagements at Covent Garden, the Bavarian State Opera and the New York Metropolitan Opera followed.

However, the commission did not come about until some years later, when the conductor's and the photographer's schedules were compatible. He says of the portrait: 'I was interested in the way great music affects us. The sheer force of such beauty causes us to fall in love.

His victory in the 400 metres freestyle at the 1998 world championships in Perth made him the youngest men's world champion in swimming history. He went on to win another four gold medals at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, earning himself his first world record as a member of the 4 x 200 metres freestyle relay team in the process. His first individual long course world record came in 1999 when he sliced two seconds off the existing 400 metres freestyle mark at the Pan Pacific Games in Sydney. He set a new world record for the 200 metres freestyle the following day, breaking his own records for both events again in qualifying for the Olympic team in May 2000. Thorpe's first Olympic campaign, in Sydney, resulted in three gold and two silver medals as well as a further three world records, making him the most successful athlete of the 2000 Games.

In 2003, in again claiming the 400 metres freestyle world title, he became the first swimmer to win the same event at three consecutive world championships. His two gold medals at the 2004 Athens Olympics came from victories in the 400 metres and 200 metres freestyle, the final of the latter event pitting him against Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband and American Michael Phelps in what some pundits dubbed swimming's 'race of the century'.

He adopted a professional stage career when he was twenty-one, leaving Melbourne in 1959 to seek success in England.  By the early sixties, characters such as Edna Everage and Sandy Stone were burned into the Australian imagination, but it took until 1976 for his solo act to take root in England. Although he soon smashed theatre records there, it was not until 1999 - forty years into Humphries's career - that American audiences took to Edna.  Eight months of sold-out Broadway shows and a 55-week nationwide tour ensued. Humphries has two honorary doctorates and has won the J.R. Ackerley Prize; the Golden Rose of Montreux; the TV Personality of the Year Award; the Drama Desk Award; the Outer Critics Circle Award; the National Broadway Award and a Special Tony Award.   Barry Humphries was an enthusiastic artist from childhood, and briefly attended the George Bell School as a teenager.  In the early 1950s he discovered the Dada painters and poets, and over the course of the decade he orchestrated several offensive Dada happenings and exhibitions in Melbourne.  Although wilfully jejune, Humphries's efforts in this art form had sufficient depth for Robert Hughes to write that he was the 'only Australian who ever really understood the Dada principle of ferocious provocation'.  By the beginning of the 1970s he had abandoned his subversive art practice to concentrate on colourful landscapes, depicting both European and Australian views.  Several of these, as well as several self-portraits, were exhibited in 2002-3 in the National Portrait Gallery's first biographical exhibition, Rarely Everage.    This work was included in an exhibition of Humphries's paintings in Brisbane in December 2002.  Margaret Olley is a long-standing friend of Humphries's.

Henceforth, her stylistically distinctive examination of women's experience and fears attracted much interest from feminist scholars, but her dozen novels, numerous radio plays and a collection of autobiographical pieces also won her a broad local and overseas readership.

The Kellys' mother and brother-in-law were jailed for their parts in the 'attempted murder', and Ned and Dan went into hiding together in the Wombat Ranges near Mansfield, Victoria.  A police party comprising Sergeant Kennedy and Constables Lonigan, Scanlon and McIntyre was dispatched to capture them. On 25 October 1878 the officers camped at Stringybark Creek, where Ned marked them.  The next day, when Kennedy and Scanlon went out to search the surrounding bush, the 'Kelly gang' - Ned, Dan, Joe Byrne and Steve Hart - ambushed Lonigan and McIntyre. Ned Kelly shot Lonigan dead as the officer drew his revolver. McIntyre surrendered, and when Kennedy and Scanlon returned, Ned called on them to do likewise. They refused; Ned Kelly killed Scanlon and mortally wounded Kennedy, later shooting him in the heart as an 'act of mercy'. McIntyre escaped to Mansfield and related the story to his colleagues. Within weeks the Victorian government advertised huge rewards for the Kelly gang members, and these rewards increased in the ensuing months.

In England, he won the English Derby, King George and Queen Elizabeth stakes, the 2,000 Guineas twice, the 1,000 Guineas, the Coronation and Ascot Gold Cups and the Gimcrack and Champagne stakes. He won the Arc De Triomphe and the Derby in France, and the San Diego Stakes in the US. Widely regarded as Australia's greatest jockey, he retired from racing in 1971, when he won his final race on Classic Mission in the Victoria Derby.

A slight, ginger-haired lefthander, Laver made his first trip overseas in 1956 and won the US Junior Championship at seventeen. In 1959, he made it into all three finals at Wimbledon, winning the mixed doubles title. He scored his first Wimbledon singles crown in 1961 and the following year became only the second player ever to claim a Grand Slam - that is, winning the French, Wimbledon, US and Australian singles titles in the same year.

He took out the Grand Slam again in 1969. Laver played Davis Cup for Australia every year from 1958 to 1962 and again in 1973, when the competition was opened to professionals for the first time.

Later, she studied psychology, music and economics part-time at Adelaide University. She married businessman Frank Buttfield in 1936. Her interest in politics was encouraged by her father, a state parliamentarian, and family friend Robert Menzies, from whom she sought advice about a political career. In 1954, she was endorsed as the Liberal Party candidate for Adelaide, unsuccessfully contesting the seat in the federal election that year. When a senate seat fell vacant in 1955, she was elected to parliament as a Liberal senator for South Australia, serving from 1955 to 1965 and again from 1968 to 1974. Though her support for women's rights put her at odds with some of her male colleagues, she lobbied on issues such as equal pay for women and for the right of married women to work in the Public Service. Despite her staunch anti-communist views, she was the first female senator to visit the USSR, and she toured China alone in 1962. She also served on many boards and made philanthropic contributions to youth and the arts. In 1972, she was made a Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.  Sir Ivor Hele (1912-1993) was born in South Australia and studied art at the Prince Alfred College, Adelaide and the South Australian School of Arts and, later, in Paris and Munich.

His postwar paintings were occasionally shown at the Adelaide Advertiser's open-air art exhibitions; his last solo exhibition was during the 1970 Adelaide Festival of the Arts. Although Hele painted landscapes and made thousands of erotic paintings and drawings, he was best known as a portrait painter. He was much in demand as an official portraitist and he won the Archibald Prize five times between 1951 and 1957, notably with his portrait of Sir Robert Menzies in 1954 and a self portrait in 1957.

He was the driving force behind the Australian National Insect Collection, the Stored Grain Research Laboratory and the use of nematodes and synthetic sex pheromones for controlling insect pests.

Since the mid- 1980s she has developed a body of large, highly coloured manipulated works in series, including Blue Narcissus, The Infinity Gardens and All the Sounds of Fear. Her 2001 series Hot House, including works made through a newly-patented lenticular process, resulted from her artist-in-residency in the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. The portrait of Waterhouse is a lenticular print, on which a microscopically corrugated surface causes the image to 'move' as the viewer changes position around the work. Around and across Waterhouse the artist placed emblems of his work and his interests, not only a scuttling dung beetle and a dancing cloud of butterflies, but a fish, referring to the scientist's unusual hobby of making 'fish prints' in the traditional Japanese manner. The lenticular print seems an especially apposite medium for depicting insects; as Stacey observes, 'the image literally appears to develop itself ... the image itself becomes a metamorphosis'.

Looking for a West Australian artist to represent Betty Cuthbert, who lives in Mandurah, near Perth, and is confined to a wheelchair, Sayers thought of Daly, feeling that the careful, domestic quality of his portraits would fit well with the personality and circumstances of the gentle track star.

Born in Yorkshire, Mawson was two years old when his family emigrated to Australia and eventually settled in the inner Sydney suburb of Glebe. He was admitted to Sydney University at age sixteen, completing studies in mining engineering and geology there before taking up a position as lecturer in mineralogy and petrology at the University of Adelaide. Mawson made the first of his three journeys to Antarctica as physicist to Sir Ernest Shackleton's British Antarctic Expedition, conducted between 1907 and 1909. On that trip and with his mentor, geologist TW Edgeworth David, Mawson completed a dangerous 122-day sled journey and recorded observations at the South Magnetic Pole. Two years later, Mawson led his own expedition, the Australasian Antarctic Expedition (AAE) of 1911-14. Notable for its numerous scientific and geographical achievements, the AAE is equally legendary for Mawson's survival during another epic sled journey to the South Pole that claimed the lives of his two companions. Mawson returned from the expedition a hero and was knighted. After serving with the British Ministry of Munitions and the Russian Military Commission during World War I, Mawson returned to Adelaide University, where he was Professor of Geology and Mineralogy for the remainder of his life. He revisited Antarctica as leader of the British, Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE) of 1929-30 and 1930-31, a venture that later resulted in Australian control of almost six million square kilometres of the continent. In 1947, Mawson completed writing and editing the twenty-two volumes of reports on the scientific findings of the AAE. He retired from the University of Adelaide - the geology building of which bears his name - in 1952. He died six years later, survived by his wife and two daughters, and was honoured with a State funeral in Adelaide. Described by Edgeworth  David as a man of 'infinite resource, splendid physique and astonishing indifference to frost', Mawson is counted among the twentieth century's most eminent explorers.

She began studying under Margaret Preston at the School of Design around 1910. Following her mother's death in 1913, Bowen decided to leave Adelaide - a place she later described as 'a queer little backwater of intellectual timidity' - and pursue a career as an artist in Europe. She arrived in London in 1914, later enrolling at the Westminster School of Art and becoming part of a circle of artists and writers that included TS Eliot, Ezra Pound and WB Yeats. She met the English novelist Ford Madox Ford in 1917 and began a relationship with him that lasted nine years during which her own work was often accorded second place to Ford's. Their daughter, Julia, was born in 1920. In France from 1922, Bowen painted landscapes and portraits of friends and family, becoming dependent on her painting for an income when her relationship with Ford ended. Bowen travelled to the USA in 1932, completing a number of portrait commissions there before returning to Europe and spending the remainder of the decade eking out a living with painting, reviewing and teaching in England and France. Her memoir, Drawn from life, appeared in 1941. In 1944, she became the second woman appointed an official war artist and was tasked with depicting the activities of the RAAF in England and the return of prisoners of war from Germany. In this role, Bowen produced a total of forty-six works, including Bomber Crew (1944), a group portrait completed from sketches she made prior to the seven-strong crew's departure on a mission from which six men did not return. Her last commission as a war artist was a depiction of George VI saluting troops on Victory Day in London in 1946. Bowen was gravely ill with cancer when she completed the painting in 1947. Wishing to return to Australia but lacking her fare, she sought, unsuccessfully, to be repatriated on a troop ship. Bowen died in England in October 1947.

He joined Ure Smith Publishers in 1950 and went on to become director of the company, which published his books Present Day Art in Australia in 1969 and Australian Painters of the '70s in 1975. In 1956 he opened one of Sydney's first coffee bars, the Galleria Espresso in Rowe Street.

Judy Cassab AO CBE (1920-2015 ) was one of Australia's best-loved, most successful and prolific portrait painters.  Born in Vienna, she studied in Prague and at the Budapest Academy before adopting false papers and 'going underground' to escape the persecution of Hungarian Jews.  After the war, she and her husband reunited and came to Australia.  Because she could not make a living through painting, and her husband did not want her to work in a factory, so she took up teaching.  She hardly spoke English and was disoriented by the strange light and seasons, but found inspiration for a more abstract style of painting in the landscape of the Northern Territory, to which she repeatedly returned.  Gradually, she made friends with artists such as Jeffrey Smart, Stanislaus Rapotec and Desiderius Orban.  In 1961 she became the first woman in twenty years to win the Archibald Prize, with a portrait of Rapotec.  She won again with a portrait of friend and fellow artist, Margo Lewers, in 1968.

Over the next twenty years, financially supported by her doctor husband Eric, she produced nine more novels, culminating in The Timeless Land, Storm of Time and No Barrier (1941-1953), a historical trilogy exploring the process of white settlement in Australia between 1788 and 1814. The Timeless Land, central characters of which included Bennelong and Barangaroo, became the Book of the Month selection on its US publication, was endorsed in the Times Literary Supplement and was a set text on the school syllabus in Victoria and New South Wales for some years.

There, he drew illustrations and cartoons for the sensational rag the Hawklet and was a member of the bohemian artists' club self-styled the Prehistoric Order of Cannibals. He spent the summer of 1897-98 living in the artists' colony of Charterisville, making drawings jointly inspired by the Decameron and the neglected gardens around his cottage.

Meanwhile, his first novel was published in 1913, and by the 1920s he was both proficient and prolific in pen and ink drawing, etching, woodcuts, painting and sculpture. A disciple of Nietzsche from early on, Lindsay loathed Christianity, and his art depicts Bohemianism and Arcadian pantheism admixed in a fantasy world.

By 1901 he was back in Europe, where he was to remain until 1910 enjoying some critical, though little financial, success. Initially, he was sponsored by Dame Nellie Melba, whose sister Belle was married to Patterson's brother Tom. During this time he became acquainted with Ramsay, with whom he shared a Paris studio, and who was to have an important influence on his work, particularly his self portraiture. Ramsay painted several brilliant portraits of Patterson, and Patterson's Parisian self portrait from 1902 is a low-keyed highlight of the collection of the National Gallery of Australia. Patterson's widow recalled 'my husband looked on Ramsay as an exceptional artist - in fact, I know he felt he was the Australian artist whose work he most admired'. Melba, however, withdrew her support from Patterson, who had married without consulting her and whose work was going in a direction of which she disapproved, and transferred her favours to Ramsay. Having returned to Australia to be feted for his international experience, in 1915 Patterson travelled to Hawaii, where he made a series of woodcuts and put an end to his marriage. Migrating to Seattle, he taught and lectured at the University of Washington Art School from 1919 to 1947, marrying a fellow artist with whom he spent significant periods in Paris and Mexico.

After winning the Mobil Song Quest in 1950, Sutherland left Australia to study at the Royal College of Music in London, making her debut at Covent Garden in 1952 in The Magic Flute. Within a few weeks she was appearing there in Norma, with Maria Callas in the title role. In London a fellow expatriate, conductor Richard Bonynge, became her mentor and later her husband. He encouraged her to abandon the heavier vocal roles she favoured and to become a coloratura soprano; the transformation was key to her success. Sutherland's 1959 performance in Lucia di Lammermoor at Covent Garden launched an international career that spanned nearly forty years, during which her distinctive voice, immense vocal range and wide repertoire earned her the title 'La Stupenda'. She was Australian of the Year in 1961, the second year the title was awarded. Thirty years later, she received the Order of Merit - one of a mere handful of Australians, and the only Australian woman, on which that honour has been bestowed. In 1974, Sutherland and Bonynge returned to Australia, and over the next decade they lent their star power to the Australian Opera. In the years following, she was designated a Living National Treasure. Sutherland lived in Switzerland for many years. When she died, it had been more than twenty years since the night on which she last performed, at Covent Garden. She was the first Australian to be given a memorial service in Westminster Abbey since Sir Robert Menzies died in 1978. Robert Hannaford (b. 1944), commissioned to paint Sutherland by the Elizabethan Theatre Trust in 1977, produced several portraits of the diva. The portrait sittings took place at Potts Point, Sydney, over a two- week period during which Sutherland was performing at the Opera House. Hannaford recalls that she would not sit on the days of performances, and that during portrait sittings she sang along to tapes provided by Richard Bonynge.

For a time he lived with Eric Clapton, collaborating with him on song lyrics and designing album covers for his band, Cream. Returning to Australia in 1969, Sharp helped set up the Yellow House, an artists' space in inner Sydney which became a focus of the underground art scene of the 1960s. Sharp is renowned for his poster designs for the Nimrod theatre in the 1970s, and for his obsessions with Tiny Tim, toys and Luna Park. In the late 1970s he was engaged to oversee the restoration of the Park, but in 1979 a terrible fire in its Ghost Train took seven lives.

She grew up in Brisbane and studied at the Universities of Queensland, Sydney, London and York before starting work at the University of Sydney in 1969. In 1980, after a postdoctoral fellowship at the Australian National University and two years as President of the Art Association of Australia, she was appointed Associate Professor of Fine Arts at Sydney, a position she held until 1993. She was a foundation member of the Society of Architectural Historians of Australia and New Zealand, and during the 1990s she was a Trustee of the Historic Houses Trust of NSW and a member of the National Portrait Gallery advisory committee.  From 1997 she was a Professor at the Centre for Cross Cultural Research at the Australian National University. Kerr was an enthusiastic advocate for rural artists, and artists working in unconventional mediums.  Peter Drewett is a Grafton craftsman.  His earliest memories of making art are copying the Rosella logo off the factory wall next to his grandmother's house in Richmond, Victoria, and fashioning little animals out of clay and sticks.  His secondary schooling focused on carpentry and woodwork, and worked as a screenprinter from the age of 16.  In the mid-1970s he took his young family to live in the bush on the north coast of NSW, building a house, furniture, sculpture and toys from bush timbers, and working as a logger for 15 years.  In 1999, after a series of personal vicissitudes, he visited the Northern Territory. Here he began experimenting with pokerwork (or 'pyrography'), an art form that he credits with restoring his sense of self worth, patience and joyfulness.  As a result of his meeting Joan Kerr, his work Unfoundlands was exhibited in the National Gallery of Australia exhibition Home Sweet Home (2003-4).  He has recently pyrographed six enormous poles supporting sails in Skinner St, South Grafton, funded by the Australia Council for the Arts.      Joan and Jim Kerr saw some of Peter Drewett's work in a shop in South Grafton in 2002 or 2003.  By chance, he was in the shop at the time, and Kerr gave him contact details for 'outsider' art collector Peter Fay. Fay commissioned a piece from Drewett, and the result was Unfoundlands, painstakingly executed on six fragile gourds.  While he was working on Unfoundlands Drewett learned that Kerr was ill.  He writes: 'I felt so much like thanking Joan for opening up my world and giving me the encouragement to believe in myself as an artist, that at the opening at the NGA  . . . I asked Mr Fay to send me any photos of Joan that may be suitable for me to do this portrait as a way of thanking her.  He sent me a copy of a photograph that Jim Kerr had taken of Joan holding a drum that I'd done, that had first caught her attention.  I feel very privileged to have been able to give the portrait to Joan only two weeks before she died and she gave me the most beautiful smile when she first saw it.  Whatever else comes from this portrait, nothing will ever be as important to me as that smile.'  This is Drewett's first portrait.

In the early 1960s she began many years' study of ikebana, the Japanese art of floral arrangement. With no formal art training, nor capacity to draw, in the 1970s she began making objects and 'assemblages' from natural and man-made materials she had salvaged and hoarded - rusted iron, drink crates, bee hives, road signs, shells, grass stalks, kewpie dolls, linoleum. In 1974 she exhibited at the Macquarie Galleries in Sydney; just four years later she had a survey show at the National Gallery of Victoria.

Over that decade, she made a series of small sculptures of cars, notably Holdens, with personifying elements such as lipstick surfboards and bridal veils, which explored notions of national and gender identity. At the time, Dodd described the Holden, Australian-manufactured but American-owned, as the 'Trojan horse of American imperialism'.  The National Gallery, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Art Gallery of South Australia all have examples of her many ceramic vehicles, as do various institutions in the US and Canada.

Born in Sydney, Kellerman was diagnosed with rickets as a child and learnt to swim when the sport was recommended as a means of strengthening her legs. Aged fifteen, Kellerman became the state champion for the 100 yards and set a world record for the mile. In Melbourne from 1903, she began giving diving demonstrations and accomplished the first of her feats of endurance swimming. Frustrated with the lack of opportunities in Australia, she went to England in 1905, earning attention with a number of marathon swims, including three attempts at swimming the English Channel. A deft self-promoter, Kellerman styled herself as the 'Australian Mermaid' and the 'Diving Venus', devising a unique stage show that eventually combined music, singing, dancing and wire-walking with diving and underwater ballet. She left for the USA in 1907 and performed in amusement parks in Chicago and Boston before being signed by New York impresario, Benjamin Franklin Keith. By 1917, she was reputedly the highest paid woman in vaudeville and had starred in the first of several feature films, each a vehicle for her stunts and mermaid routines. These ventures powered Kellerman's parallel profile as a fitness advocate and populariser of the women's one-piece swimming costume. Declared 'the Perfect Woman' in 1908, Kellerman was a potent embodiment of modern femininity and her attitudes on exercise and swimwear issued a strident challenge to notions of 'decency'. She promoted her beliefs in the pioneering books Physical Beauty: how to keep it (1918) and How to swim (1918). Kellerman spent World War II touring with her own theatre troupe, performing charity shows for soldiers in Australia and the Pacific. Staying true to her belief in the benefits of a daily swim until very late in her life she died in 1975, aged eighty-nine. Walter Barnett (1862-1934) set up Falk Studios in Sydney in 1885 and it became not only the leader in portraits of contemporary Australian stars, but also captured many celebrated visitors to the country, including Sarah Bernhardt, Robert Louis Stevenson and Mark Twain.

Having briefly studied piano at the University of Queensland, he enlisted in the RAAF in 1940, serving as a wireless operator in Townsville and performing in concerts as a member of the service's entertainment unit. Discharged from the Air Force on medical grounds in 1945, Grainer studied under Eugene Goossens at Sydney's Conservatorium of Music before moving to London in the early sixties and becoming a rehearsal pianist for the BBC. He gained attention for his theme for the Maigret series, and in 1962 wrote the music from which the theme to Steptoe and Son was taken. The following year he was asked to provide the opening music for a new children's science fiction series entitled Doctor Who. Grainer's theme, considered a pioneering piece of electronic music and later reinterpreted by bands including Pink Floyd, Thin Lizzy and The Pogues, is still in use 50 years later as the BBC embarks on production of the 2014 incarnation of the series.

Mackie's life of activism began when as a young stowaway on a boat from New Zealand, he challenged the captain as to the lawfulness of his uncomfortable accommodation.  Working in blue collar jobs around the globe, he became a member of the Industrial Workers of the World and the United States Seafarers Unions before ending up central Queensland.  The dispute of 1964/5, one of Australia's major rank and file uprisings, arose over management's failure to provide showers for miners.  As it escalated, Queensland Premier Frank Nicklin described Mackie as a 'vicious gangster' and the strike as a 'communist strategy to retard and even prevent major developmental projects in this state'; the government vainly explored all possible avenues to have him deported.  The strike and the rest of the unionist's tumultuous life are described in Mount Isa: The Story of a Dispute (1989) and Many Ships to Mount Isa (c. 2002).   Nancy Borlase AM, painter and writer, was 23 when she came to Sydney from New Zealand, where she had studied art and written a book.  She continued her art studies at the East Sydney Technical College, and with Rah Fizelle and Grace Crowley.  She was a member of the Contemporary Art Society from 1952 to 1970; in 1960 her first solo exhibition was held at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries.

His first exhibition was held at Melbourne's Guild Hall in 1908.  His career grew steadily; Art in Australia ran a special Heysen number in 1920. After he settled on a 150 acre property near Hahndorf in the Adelaide hills he specialised in depictions of bush landscapes, concentrating hard on eucalypts, of which he is popularly regarded as the pre-eminent interpreter.  From 1926 he made many charcoal drawings and paintings in the Flinders Ranges.  He won the Wynne Prize for landscape nine times between 1904 and 1932.  From 1940, for 28 years he served on the Board of the Art Gallery of South Australia.

Born in Jeparit, Victoria, Menzies attended school in Ballarat and studied at Melbourne University, where he gained a reputation as a brilliant speaker. Following early success at the Bar and in state politics, he entered Federal parliament in 1934. He became prime minister in 1939 as leader of the United Australia Party, but bitter divisions led to his resignation and the disintegration of the UAP. From the back benches, Menzies founded the Liberal Party, which he led from 1944 to 1966. As prime minister through a period of remarkable national prosperity, Menzies cultivated the USA as a 'powerful friend', furthering the two nations' economic and military ties. A staunch monarchist, he was invested as a Knight of the Thistle and succeeded Winston Churchill as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports from 1965 to 1978. Menzies's nickname, Ming, originated in the Scottish pronunciation of his name, Ming-ees, which Menzies preferred to the usual pronunciation, possibly because it was the way the Queen said his name. The nickname took on a new dimension when a newspaper columnist extended it to 'Ming the Merciless' after the Emperor in the Flash Gordon comic strip. 'Fling out Ming' subsequently became an election slogan, but Menzies was to retire, not to be voted out of office.

He lectured on local geology and botany and explored between Newcastle and Moreton Bay before taking over a proposed expedition from Sydney to Port Essington (300km north of modern Darwin) in 1844. After fifteen months Leichhardt and six others made Port Essington and sailed home to Sydney, where he was dubbed the Prince of Explorers. The journey disclosed much prime pastoral land, winning Leichhardt the prize for the most important geographical discovery from the Geographical Society of Paris and a medal from its London counterpart. In March 1848, having explored more territory in Queensland, he set out from its Condamine River for Swan River in WA, but his party was lost as of 3 April 1848. Leichhardt collected many useful specimens and his diaries, notebooks, sketchbooks, letters, and published works are notable for their absence of exaggeration. Novelist Patrick White drew on aspects of Leichhardt's story for his novel Voss, one of the works for which he won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Charles Rodius was born in Germany and went to England sometime before 1829, when he was convicted of stealing a lady's handbag and transported to New South Wales for seven years. He was immediately employed as an architectural draughtsman and drawing teacher by the Department of Public Works, and also gave drawing lessons to children of prominent residents of Sydney. He attained his freedom in 1841, by which time he had completed two series of portraits of Aborigines, other portraits in chalk, pencil and oils, and a number of landscapes. A portrait of Leichhardt by Rodius was exhibited in the Society for the Promotion of the Fine Arts in Australia exhibition of 1857. Having enjoyed financial success, yet suffered a stroke and the deaths of two wives, Rodius died at the Liverpool Hospital three years later.

When he and Neville re-located Oz to London, Sharp continued as art director, producing psychedelic rock-star and 'legalise pot' posters that were sold through the magazine. For a time he lived with Eric Clapton, collaborating with him on song lyrics and designing album covers for his band, Cream.  Returning to Australia in 1969 Sharp helped set up the 'Yellow House', an artists' space at Potts Point in Sydney which became a focus of the underground art scene of the 1960s. Sharp is well known for his poster designs for the Nimrod theatre in the 1970s, and for his obsessions with Tiny Tim, toys and Luna Park.    Born in Sydney, Garry Shead studied at the National Art School in 1961-2.  With Martin Sharp, Jon Firth Smith and Ian van Wieringen he edited The Arty Wild Oat and published cartoons in the Oz, The Bulletin, The Sydney Morning Herald, and Honi Soit.  He worked for several years as a scenic artist with the ABC before winning the Young Contemporaries Prize in 1967.  His work is represented in the National Gallery, several state galleries and many public and private collections; he won the Archibald Prize in 1993 for his portrait of an old friend, Sydney publisher Tom Thompson.

This long commission had all the ingredients of Pop art: the nostalgic elements, huge sculptures, powerful images, wonderful paintings by Arthur Barton along with bright colours and lights. In 1978 Sharp and fellow artist/designer Richard Liney, also an avid collector of memorabilia loaned their combined collection of hundreds of fairground, circus, Luna Park and sideshow artifacts to the Art Gallery of NSW to coincide with the Festival of Sydney. In 1979 a tragic fire in the Luna Park Ghost Train claimed seven lives . . .  Martin's work on the Luna Park Face was ruined, and the park's theme 'Just for Fun' lost its meaning.  Martin firmly believes the fire was an act of terrorism  . . . Along with various other artist friends and sympathetic supporters, Martin was instrumental in forming the Friends of Luna Park in an endeavour to remind the people of Sydney and the State Government of what they stood to lose if the site were developed.'

Educated in Sydney, he worked at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children (which became the New Children's Hospital, Westmead) from 1961 to 1997, retiring as its Chief Executive in 1997.  Since then, he has been its Emeritus Consulting Physician, and he was Chairman of its Governing Council from 1998 to 2000.  Chancellor of the University of New South Wales since 2000, he has also served on a variety of boards and associations related to children's health, medicine and the arts.  He is currently Vice-Chair of the Board of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, and has also been associated with the Powerhouse Museum, the Penrith Regional Art Gallery and Musica Viva.  He has published a number of books and many papers on paediatrics, management and decorative arts.  Yu was Australian of the Year in 1996.   Ah Xian came to Australia from Beijing in 1989, having already gained some recognition and experience as an artist here. His application for permanent residency took many years to process, and he worked for a long time as a house painter.  He began casting porcelain busts and painting them with traditional Chinese designs in 1997; an artist-in-residency followed, he sold a bust to Sydney's Powerhouse Museum, and he held his first solo show in Melbourne in 2000.  The following year, he won the National Gallery of Australia's inaugural National Sculpture Prize with his life-size painted cloisonne enamel figure Human human: lotus.  At the end of 2001 the National Portrait Galley approached him about a commissioned work.  He hesitated, because making a porcelain bust is dangerously unpredictable: the work may break at any stage, the process is very expensive, and it takes a long time.  But he met John Yu in early 2003, found him 'kind and gentle', and made a cast of his head and shoulders.  By mid-2003 Ah Xian had conceived the design; there was to be 'a contrast and tension between the completely celadon bust of John Yu and colourful little children climbing around him, yet great harmony as well.'  He explained that this mimics the Chinese traditional style of putting some little children's figures around the Laughing Buddha and Guanyin (the mercy god).  'I believe that this design will confirm Chinese traditions as part of John's and my cultural background, the characteristic way I make my works, and John's joy and passion in collecting ceramic vessels especially in celadon.'  The bust of Yu is currently under way.  Ah Xian sent sketch for the perusal of the NPG Board in June 2003.

His 1954 Sonatina for piano was selected for performance in Germany in 1955; and in 1958 he won a scholarship to study at Oxford. In 1966 Sculthorpe gained a Harkness Fellowship to study in the US and later became composer-in-residence at Yale University. Sculthorpe stated in 1998 that, by being overseas, he 'gained a perspective on what I had left behind at home'; consequently, a number of his major works explore aspects of Australian climate, landscape, history and Indigenous culture, such as Irkanda IV (1961), Sun Music I and Sun Music III (1965  1967), Port Essington (1977) and Kakadu (1988). In the late 1960s, Sculthorpe was appointed Reader in Music at Sydney University, and later held a personal chair as its Professor in Musical Composition. A member of the Order of the British Empire and the Order of Australia, Sculthorpe counted being named a National Living Treasure as among the most significant of his many honours and awards.

At this time she reclaimed her totemic name, which means wattle flower (it was spelled Thancoupie until 1987, when she decided it would be better spelled Thanacoupie). For thirty years she was the foremost Aboriginal potter and ceramic sculptor, expressing her relationship with the land, living things and the elements through a medium that was used only for ceremonial purposes and decoration in her native community. The spherical sculpture on the grass near the front entrance of the adjacent National Gallery of Australia is by Thanacoupie. She held sixteen solo exhibitions and numerous group shows throughout Australia and abroad, and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Queensland in 1998.

Five years later they moved into Rona, which was destined to be home to five generations of the family.  Ned and Edith Knox had four daughters.  One of their granddaughters, Helen, married her mother's second cousin, Thomas Rutledge, in 1935, and they went to live at Gidleigh, a property near Bungendore, NSW.  In 1978, leaving Gidleigh in the hands of her son, Helen Rutledge returned to live at Rona.

Hurley became interested in photography as a teenager, acquiring his first camera at seventeen and a job with a Sydney postcard company before he turned twenty. He was twenty-five when he persuaded Douglas Mawson to take him on as the official photographer for the AAE (the British photographer, Herbert Ponting, had been Mawson's first choice). Working in extreme conditions, Hurley took numerous photographs and the footage that was later released as the documentary Home of the Blizzard (1913). Hurley was also the official photographer for Ernest Shackleton's ill-fated British Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914-1917, during which he created the celebrated photographs of the expedition ship Endurance being slowly crushed in the polar ice. Hurley served as an official photographer during World War I, earning a reputation among the troops as 'the mad photographer' for the risks he took to get the perfect shot. His many photographs of battlefields in Belgium and France are now considered iconic, but were the cause of conflict with Australia's official war historian, Charles Bean, who rejected Hurley's method of forming single images from a composite of negatives. Hurley had great flair for showmanship and spent much of the period after the war presenting illustrated lectures and exhibitions of his photographs, making popular documentary and fiction films, and working for the newsreel company, Cinesound. Hurley made his third trip to Antarctica, again with Mawson, in the British, Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE) of 1929-31, producing two films - Southward Ho! with Mawson and Siege of the South - as a result. He served with the AIF in the Middle East in World War II. In addition to his famous wartime and Antarctic work, Hurley's career produced several documentaries and travelogues; two feature films; and numerous books about Australia and his travels.

After graduating from technical college in Bury, Lancashire, Malin began his career as an assistant in a pesticide laboratory. Within a decade he was head of the electron microscopy laboratory of the research department of Ciba-Geigy. He moved to Australia in 1975 and joined the Anglo-Australian Observatory in NSW; he was to retire from the AAO as a principal research scientist in 2001. As he explains it, his achievement has been to 'devise novel ways of extracting more information  from  photographs ... [leading to] some interesting astronomical discoveries as well as ... useful advances in photographic science.' Malin won his first astronomical awards in 1985, when he took out the Henri Chretien Award of the American Astronomical Society and the Jackson-Gwilt Medal and Prize of the Royal Astronomical Society. He has since received many photographic awards including the Rodman Medal of the Royal Photographic Society and the Progress Medal of the Photographic Society of America. The Malin Award is the premier Australian astrophotography competition. Author of a host of scientific papers and essays and recipient of honorary doctorates from the University of Sydney and RMIT University, he has two patents to his name. He has held many solo photographic exhibitions internationally, and his books  include Catalogue of the Universe (1979, 1980), Colours of the Stars (1984), Explorers of the Southern Sky: A History of Astronomy in Australia (1996) and Deep Sky Objects (2000). A documentary about Malin's work, The Man Who Colours Stars, was released in 1997. Amongst his projects is Starchant, a visual production to accompany performances of Ross Edwards's 4th Symphony in Adelaide (2005). Since 1996 Malin has been Adjunct Professor of Scientific Photography at RMIT University. Malin is pictured in the prime focus cage of the Anglo-Australian Observatory telescope.

In 1949 he was appointed a principal research scientist with the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, from which he retired thirty-four years later. In the mid-1950s, he was involved in investigations into the crash of the world's first jet-powered aircraft, the Comet. He envisaged a machine placed in all aircraft, continually recording details and able to be recovered after a crash. His prototype attracted little local notice, but in 1958 he took it to England, where the Ministry of Aviation expressed strong interest in his idea; the device was also successfully demonstrated in Canada. A continuing lack of Australian support for its development saw other countries capture the growing market for the apparatus, which was recommended for installation in Australian aircraft only after the inquiry into the crash of a Fokker Friendship at Mackay (Queensland) in 1960. Australia was the first country in the world to make cockpit- voice recording compulsory. The 'black box' flight recorder (which is never, in fact, black) has since been universally adopted as a means to investigate accidents and to prevent their recurrence. Warren published many scientific papers on a variety of subjects besides cockpit recording and served on a number of scientific committees. A founder of the Australian and New Zealand chapters of the Combustion Institute, he was its president from 1959 to 1985.

Milpurrurru was a member of the Gurrumba Gurrumba ('flock of geese') clan; frequent motifs in his work are the flying foxes, magpie geese, crocodiles, tortoises and pythons that abound in his country. In 1979, he and David Malangi became the first indigenous artists to exhibit at the Biennale of Sydney. As a senior artist he painted nine burial poles for the Aboriginal Memorial of the National Gallery of Australia, which was unveiled at the Biennale of Sydney in 1988. From then on, he also painted on canvas and paper. He was the first living Aboriginal artist to be honoured with an individual show - at the National Gallery of Australia in 1993.  That year Milpurrurru and Others v. Indofurn became an important case in the history of application of copyright to indigenous arts.

His unique landscape vision emerged in the late 1950s, after his return from a period of study and work in London. The 1960s saw an increasing minimalism in his paintings, which reached its most extreme point at the end of the decade. In his monumental works of 1969, he attempted to evoke the vast scale of the Australian land through canvases of a single colour dotted with tiny flecks of paint. Although Williams later turned to representation of denser, more colourful country, his bare, uncompromising pictures of the 1960s contributed profoundly to subsequent interpretation of the Australian landscape. Williams painted few self portraits; this painting, one of the very first acquisitions of the National Portrait Gallery, was the last and most considered of them. The quiet assurance of the artist, dressed rather formally in suit and tie, coincides with the increasing maturity of his landscape vision in the early 1960s. The work of painting is emphasised; here is no tousle-haired, tortured genius but a diffident, sober man going about his business. Although the self portrait seems quite different from a 'typical' Williams landscape, the treatment of the jacket is reminiscent of that of rocks and trees in his landscapes of the same period and the work is characteristically enlivened with touches of vibrant colour on cheekbones and ears. Rennie Ellis (1940-2003) was a photographer and writer. Founder and director of Brummels Gallery of Photography, Australia's first gallery dedicated to photographs, Ellis published some seventeen books and his photographs, widely exhibited in Australia and overseas, are held in many public and private collections.

In 1973, with fibre artist Mona Hessing, Gazzard was one of the first craftspeople invited to exhibit at the National Gallery of Victoria. The exhibition, Clay and Fibre, generated much discussion about whether craft was art and accelerated acceptance of women artists. Through the seventies and eighties she exhibited large abstract works in a number of important group shows and held the first Chair of the Crafts Board of the Australia Council. During this period she turned for inspiration to fossils; Maltese idols; and Aboriginal dreamings and Central Australian landscapes. President of the World Crafts Council from 1980 to 1984, Gazzard was commissioned to create the bronze sculpture Mingarri: the Little Olgas (1988) which stands in the central Executive Courtyard of Parliament House, Canberra.

He was discharged from a field hospital the following month, having contracted influenza, and later suffered mumps. Shipped home as medically unfit following the evacuation, he returned to Australia, where he was to father nine children - the last born when he was 69.  Working as a railway carriage builder from the mid-1920s until the beginning of World War 2, he was active in the Australian Railways Union.

After hosting a lunch in his Brisbane flat for actress Vivien Leigh, he was invited by Maureen Kistle, the presenter of ABC TV's A Woman's World and a guest at the event, to demonstrate his cooking skills on her show. He went on to host a daily segment on the Ten Network's Good Morning Australia before getting his own show, King's Kitchen. During the 70s and 80s, he was a regular on the game show Celebrity Squares, and a judge on the talent quests New Faces, Pot of Gold and Pot Luck, becoming notorious in this role for the poor scores and cruel comments he claimed to have issued to contestants in kindness. 'No one has the courage to tell them that they're awful', he said, 'I'm the only person who is sincere'. Just before his sudden death in 2002, he filmed a pilot for a comeback television show on which he would pass judgment - presumably harshly - on recipes cooked by viewers.

In 1918 she married Frank Moulden, who was made Mayor of Adelaide a few years later. As Lady Mayoress, she raised enormous sums for Adelaide's charities. Over the course of the 1920s Lady Moulden became convinced of the potential of a rare mineral, tantalite, found in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. After visiting sites in the outback, she formulated export plans, and pressed the merits of Australian tantalite on visits to the USA and England. In 1936, by which time she had been awarded an honorary doctorate, she married again; henceforth known as Dr Buller Murphy, she lived in Victoria, and worked vigorously on behalf of various good causes, notably British war orphans.

Within a few years of his arrival, the most significant sectarian conflict in Australian history developed out of his opposition to Prime Minister Billy Hughes's bid to introduce conscription. In 1920, the British navy intercepted a ship carrying Mannix to prevent his visiting insurgent Ireland. Over his 50 years in Melbourne, he gained a huge, devoted Catholic and working-class following, antagonising establishment Protestants with his open hostility to the crown and establishing a reputation for belligerence and social divisiveness as he denounced evils such as freemasonry, mixed marriage and birth control. In later life Mannix was mentor to BA Santamaria, the high-profile scourge of communism. He died, with all faculties undiminished, at 99, having collapsed at race time on Melbourne Cup Day 1963.

Having performed together as The Rattlesnakes, they emigrated to Australia in 1958, settling in Redcliffe, just north of Brisbane. Playing gigs at Redcliffe Speedway and along the Gold Coast, they attracted the attention of Bill Gates, who played their songs on his wireless program Swinging Gates's Platter Chatter, and Col Joye, who helped them get a record deal in 1963. After several singles, in 1965 they released their first LP, with the unambiguous title The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs. Their 1966 single 'Spicks and Specks' reached number 1 and was named Go-Set's single of the year just as the band left to seek its fortune in London. Their debut English single, 'New York Mining Disaster 1941', was the first of many international hits. In 1977 their soundtrack album for Saturday Night Fever would become the largest-selling movie soundtrack in history (although it was unaccountably overlooked for Oscar nomination); at one point, Barry Gibb could count five of his songs in the US Top 10 at once. In 1979 they starred alongside Peter Frampton in their first and last Hollywood movie, the big-budget calamity Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

He acquired land and became involved in overlanding livestock before settling in South Australia in 1839. In May of that year, he set out on an expedition that took him to the Spencer Gulf and towards the Flinders Ranges. He then went to Port Lincoln and traversed the peninsula that now bears his name, returning via the Gawler Ranges and Lake Torrens. In January 1840 he learned of a planned expedition to find an overland route to the west. Eyre persuaded the organisers to refocus the expedition on the north, agreeing to pay for half of this bid to 'discover the inland of Australia'. He departed Adelaide again in June 1840 and proceeded to his depot at Mount Arden, at the head of the Spencer Gulf. Eyre's various attempts to continue north in search of fertile land were thwarted by vast expanses of salt lakes. He made it north east to a rise he named Mount Hopeless, in the Flinders Ranges, before returning to the depot. He then decided to head west across the Bight with a party comprising his assistant, John Baxter, and three Aboriginal men. Several gruelling months into the trip, Baxter was killed and two of the other members of the party disappeared. Eyre and his remaining Aboriginal colleague, Wylie, staggered into Albany on 7 July 1841. Six years later Eyre was rewarded for the journey with the Founder's Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society. In 1844, after having served as Protector of Aborigines in South Australia, he sailed home. His career ended contentiously in Jamaica in 1865 after he had violently quelled what he perceived as a coming rebellion. He was exonerated by a Royal Commission, but a welter of court proceedings ensued in England, with a register of the eminent persons of the day taking sides for and against his actions. For the last twenty-five years of his life Eyre lived on a pension in seclusion with his family near Tavistock, England. Julia Margaret Cameron (1815-1879) is considered one of the nineteenth century's pre-eminent photographers. A mother of six, Cameron took up photography at age forty-eight after receiving a camera as a gift. Largely self-taught, she converted a chicken coop into a studio and between 1864 and 1875 produced images that explored the 'high art' possibilities of a mechanical medium. Cameron employed her family, friends and acquaintances as models, but is best known for having created portraits of Victorian luminaries, including Charles Darwin, Alfred Tennyson and John Herschel.

Marchesi identified her as 'la nouvelle Melba' and gave her the name Alda. She made her European debut in 1904, and by 1908, when she described herself as Australian, she had appeared at the Monnaie, Brussels, Covent Garden and La Scala. In that year she became a member of New York's Metropolitan Opera. She was to stay with the company for 21 years. Noted especially for lyrical roles such as Manon Lescaut, Mim and Desdemona, she enjoyed a successful recording career, making her debut with Caruso, who claimed that his voice and hers blended perfectly: 'I have never found that with any other woman singer', he said. Alda toured Australia and New Zealand in 1927, by which time she had reportedly come to 'disdain' Australia. Her colourful memoirs, Men, Women and Tenors, which include a description of her marriage to Guilio Gatti Casazza, general manager of La Scala and then the Met ('the two most grievous errors I made were when I married him, and when I divorced him') were published in 1937. Herman Mishkin was the pre- eminent photographer of opera stars of the 'Golden Age'. Born in Minsk, Russia, Mishkin moved to the USA in 1885. While working as a store clerk in the lower east side of New York City, he became caught up in the amateur photography boom of the 1880s. After working with the Manhattan Opera Company as a photographer-publicist, and building up a specialisation in portraiture, he first supplied the Metropolitan Opera with photographs in 1905. From 1910 to 1932 he was the Met's photographer of choice for lobby shots and portraits, in the early years persuading operatic set painters to supply him with artful studio backdrops.

After having served as an army storeman in the Wimmera, he became associated with the modernist art patrons John and Sunday Reed at Heide, Victoria. At Heide between 1945 and 1947 he made the enormously complex series of paintings of Ned Kelly for which he is best known.

Henceforth he developed his major interests, prevention of spread of HIV and hepatitis C among injecting drug users, brief interventions for problem drinkers, treatment of drug users in prison and drug policy reform. He helped establish Australia's first needle syringe program in 1986, and instigated Australia's first medically- supervised injecting room, seeing both initiatives legalised some years later. President of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation, and the President of the International Harm Reduction Association from 1996 to 2004, he has been a member of a number of state and national committees including the National Expert Advisory Committee on Alcohol. He has often worked in developing countries to help control HIV infection among injecting drug users, and his recommendations attract increasing international interest. After thirty years at St Vincent's, he retired in 2012, and is now an Emeritus Consultant. Wodak has published over 200 scientific papers, co-wrote the book Drug Prohibition: a call for change (1996), and is a regular contributor to the current-issues website The Conversation.

With what he learned of the 'topography' of Wodak's face in completing the big work, added to the 'visual data' he had assimilated throughout his whole acquaintance with him, Mourtzakis made an oil portrait, measuring only 40.5 x 30.5cm, that he considered his 'final portrait' of the reformer.

He was a member of the premiership- winning Hawthorn sides of 1983, 1986, 1988 and 1989 - playing for much of the 1989 grand final against Geelong with broken ribs and a punctured lung. The joint winner of the 1986 Brownlow Medal, Di Pierdomenico retired in 1991 having kicked 130 goals, played in 24 finals and been selected for the All Australian side three times. He was named in Hawthorn's Team of the Century in 2001 and inducted into the AFL Hall of Fame in 2007. Rennie Ellis (1940-2003) began taking photographs while travelling around the world in the 1960s. He completed studies in advertising in his native Melbourne in 1966 and worked in a number of ad agencies before deciding to become a freelance photographer, writer and filmmaker in 1969. In 1972, he founded Brummels Gallery of Photography, the first Australian gallery dedicated to photographs; and in 1975 established Rennie Ellis  Associates. Between this time and his death in 2003, Ellis's work was acquired by public and private collections and exhibited widely in Australia and overseas. Following the 2006 exhibition Rennie Ellis: Aussies All, the National Portrait Gallery purchased thirteen of his photographs, including this work from his series documenting Australian Rules grand finals of the 1970s and 1980s.

The attentions of women make it difficult for Alvin to hold down a job.  He eventually becomes a water-bed installer, but the predation of his clients forces him to a psychiatrist, who sets him up in a clinic where he 'services' the doctor's frustrated patients.

His interest in the visual arts led him to accept the position of inaugural Chairman of the Board of the Australian National Gallery from 1982 to 1986. At the end of this period he established The Gordon Darling Australian Print Fund, which has acquired more than 6000 prints for the national collection to date. In 1991 he established the Gordon Darling Foundation, which provides funding and staff development opportunities for public art institutions Australia-wide. That year, too, he and his wife, Marilyn, initiated and facilitated the touring exhibition Uncommon Australians: Towards an Australian Portrait Gallery. The interest generated by the exhibition led to the establishment of the National Portrait Gallery. Amongst the very earliest acquisitions of the Gallery were gifts from Darling, who accepted the inaugural Board's invitation to become the Founding Patron of the Gallery in mid-1998.

Two years later he was appointed superintendent of the Port Phillip District, in which capacity he was answerable to the governor of New South Wales, George Gipps. Lending no direct support to hopes for separation, La Trobe had some difficulty administering a disparate collection of separatist free settlers who resented control from Sydney, and was attacked in the Town Council and the Argus as the 1840s wore on. However, strongly opposed to transportation to Port Phillip, he gained popularity in 1849  for forwarding a cargo of convicts to Sydney in defiance of the Colonial Office. In 1850, when Victoria became a separate colony, La Trobe was appointed its lieutenant-governor. Gold was discovered the following year, and his new government had to scramble to rise to the nightmarish administrative challenge of the gold rush. Though he kept the government functioning and preserved social order, La Trobe never gained much public or personal confidence in his performance as governor. He left Victoria in 1854, having established the Melbourne Botanic Gardens and having provided key support for the foundation of several important public health and cultural institutions, including the hospital and the university. Thomas Woolner (1825-1892) was a English sculptor who worked in Australia during the early 1850s. Woolner's training in art began with lessons from brothers Henry and William Behnes, a painter and sculptor respectively. Woolner worked for William Behnes for several years before, in 1842, being admitted to study at the Royal Academy. His work was admired by the artist William Holman Hunt; this, and his acquaintanceship with Dante Gabriel Rossetti, saw him become a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848. He contributed poetry to the Brotherhood's journal, The Germ, but his efforts to establish a successful career as a sculptor were largely fruitless, prompting him to leave for the Victorian goldfields in 1852. After six disappointing months in the Ovens River and Castlemaine districts, Woolner went back to Melbourne to resume work as a sculptor, the patronage of people such as La Trobe subsequently helping him secure several commissions. He exhibited in the Victorian Society of Fine Arts exhibition in 1853 and then spent six months in Sydney before returning to England in July 1854. He became one of the leading sculptors of the Victorian age, a professor at the Royal Academy and a successful poet.

Meanwhile, by the early 1960s, the Australian Women's Weekly had grown to a circulation exceeding 800,000, helping Australian Consolidated Press (as it was known from 1957) become the largest magazine publisher in the southern hemisphere by the time of Packer's death. An enthusiastic rugby player, cricketer and rower at school, Packer was later known for his love of horseracing, polo and yachting, chairing the syndicate which built Gretel I and Gretel II to challenge for the America's Cup in 1962 and 1970.   Packer was also a keen art collector and supported artists through the prizes sponsored by the Australian Women's Weekly. Judy Cassab's two consecutive wins in the women's section of the Weekly's Portrait Prize (in 1955 and 1956) brought her to the attention of Packer and resulted in the creation of this portrait, an Archibald Prize finalist for 1956. It was acquired by Australian Consolidated Press some years later. On donating the work to the National Portrait Gallery in 2006, his widow and second wife, Florence, Lady Packer, recalled that it had 'lived mainly in Frank's favourite place: the office'.

Henceforth she performed regularly at Covent Garden, where she maintained a private dressing room and gave her final performance in 1926. Over the same period, mobbed everywhere by fans and enjoying the attention of many lovers including Philippe, Duc d'Orl\u00e9ans, she made sensational tours of the USA and Europe.

Returning to Australia in 1949 with her second husband and their son, Florence took up landscape painting and during the 1950s exhibited her works at the David Jones Art Gallery and at venues in Brisbane and Canberra. In 1959, she established Australian (Hand Printed) Wallpapers Pty Ltd. and, with a small staff, produced a range of high-quality wallpapers from a workshop situated at the back of her St Leonards car dealership. Within a decade, Broadhurst had built a considerable reputation for wallpaper designs that were typically as bold, vibrant and flamboyant as she was, and which were unique for their experimentation with printing techniques, finishes and textures. The company became known as Florence Broadhurst Wallpapers Pty Ltd on its relocation to premises in Paddington in 1969, thereafter exporting its products internationally. The Broadhurst Design Collection had grown to some 800 patterns when Florence was murdered in the Paddington factory in October 1977. The case has never been solved. In recent years, many of Broadhurst's wallpapers have been reissued commercially, and fashion designers including Akira Isogawa have created fabrics based on her designs. Broadhurst has also been the subject of two biographies and Gillian Armstrong's 2006 documentary, Unfolding Florence.

Though the court found in Dobell's favour, the trial was debilitating for both artist and sitter, but the following year Smith won the Archibald himself.

Two and half years into his third voyage and having circumnavigated the largest island of Hawaii, Cook anchored his ships, Resolution and Discovery, in Kealekekua Bay in January 1779. The voyagers were welcomed, and relations between the Hawaiians and Europeans remained largely peaceful during the expedition's stay. Shortly after departing Kealekekua, however, Cook returned to make repairs and relations then deteriorated. Things came to a head when Cook decided to force the return of a stolen ship's cutter by taking the Hawaiian king hostage. He went ashore with ten men to bring the plan into effect; shots were fired in the confusion and a Hawaiian chief was killed. Cook and his men were attacked as they retreated to their boats; Cook shot and killed another warrior and in return was stabbed.  News of Cook's demise reached England ahead of the return of the expedition and quickly became the subject of souvenir images. Engravers Francesco Bartolozzi and William Byrne issued this work in 1784, basing it closely on John Webber's oil painting of the awful events in Hawaii. Webber was not an eye-witness to Cook's death, but as the official artist of the expedition, on his return he painted what were to become the most famous of all depictions of it - in at least two versions, the first in watercolours and the second in oils. Francesco Bartolozzi was responsible for the figures in the engraving and William Byrne provided the landscape. The view appeared at about the same time as the official third voyage account was published; although lavishly illustrated by Webber, the official account did not include any depiction of this scene.

As a boy, Mai had fled Raiatea when it was attacked by people from the neighbouring island of Bora Bora. He took refuge in Tahiti and then Huahine, where Cook and Furneaux met him in 1773. On board the Adventure, Mai was tutored in English language and manners by the ship's second lieutenant, James Burney, who described him as being 'possessed of many great qualities'. Arriving at Spithead in 1774, Mai met with Lord Sandwich, First Lord of the Admiralty, and was placed in the care of Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, who, with Burney, were among the few able to communicate with him. Banks installed Mai in his London residence; paid his bills for such things as clothes, wine and servants; and, with Solander, presented him to King George III and Queen Charlotte. While in London, Mai was introduced to such eminent figures as Samuel Johnson and Burney's sister, Fanny, the novelist and diarist. Mai's bearing and social skills made him a great success and he was embraced by London society as an embodiment of popular notions of the charm and sensuality of the South Seas. Mai also sat for his portrait to artists including Sir Joshua Reynolds and Nathaniel Dance, whose splendid representations of his 'tall and very well made' frame were then issued as engravings, evincing Mai's appeal to the worldly eighteenth century imagination and the currency of ideas regarding the 'Noble Savage'. For Mai, however, the London sojourn had a clear political agenda: to seek British support (and firearms) for a war by which he hoped to reclaim Raiatea from its invaders. Supplied with muskets and gunpowder among various other items, Mai sailed home with Cook when the navigator left on his third voyage in 1776.

Three years later, he shared the Nobel Prize with AF Huxley and AL Hodgkin. President of the Australian Academy of Science from 1957 until 1961, Eccles worked in the USA from 1966 onward and retired to Switzerland, where he is buried. Nearly a fifth of his staggering pile of publications dealt with the question of the relationship between the mind and the brain. As he grew old, the father of nine came to see the field of his life's work as central to 'the mysteries of coming to be, and the mysteries of ceasing to be'.  Pamela MacFarlane was born in Dunedin, New Zealand and completed a Master's degree in Zoology at the University of Otago in the 1940s. During part of this period she also studied at the Dunedin School of Art. In 1949, when she was working as a publications illustrator at the University of Western Australia, she married physiologist Victor MacFarlane. After some years in Brisbane and New York, in 1959 the MacFarlanes moved to Canberra, where Victor became a Professorial Fellow under Eccles at the John Curtin School of Medical Research. During their time in the capital, Pamela MacFarlane made several pastel drawings of Eccles and painted a commissioned work, Uroboros 1963, for the Junior Common Room of the ANU's Bruce Hall. In 1964, when Victor accepted a position at the Waite Institute, the family moved to Crafers in the Adelaide Hills. Here, much of her work was to be destroyed in the catastrophic bush fires of 1983. MacFarlane held about fifteen solo exhibitions in Dunedin, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and Canberra, and participated in many group shows. She is represented in the National Gallery of Australia, the state galleries of South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania and University collections in Brisbane and Canberra.

His term began terribly when his wife died after giving birth to a son in April 1857. Over the next six years Barkly's priority was securing stable government - a challenge, as into the 1890s the parliament was to comprise generally independent members who aggregated into factions according to the issues of the day. Meanwhile, he was a strong supporter of philanthropic and intellectual movements; he was a founder and President of the Royal Society of Victoria, and helped to found the National Gallery, the Acclimatization Society and the National Observatory. It was Barkly who proposed - in 1861 - that the Victorian Exploring Expedition should be known henceforth as the Burke and Wills Exploring Expedition. In 1863 he became Governor of Mauritius; seven years later he was sent to the Cape of Good Hope, where he made several regrettable decisions before being recalled to England in 1877. In retirement, as an elected Fellow of the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society, he applied himself to science. Thomas Clark (c. 1814-1883), teacher and painter, arrived in Victoria from England in about 1852, having been anatomical draftsman at King's College London and headmaster of the Birmingham School of Design.

Soon after arriving in the colony he was appointed a Master Mariner by Lieutenant-Governor, William Sorell and was given the command of the government schooner, Waterloo, one of two vessels tasked with plying the route between Hobart and the penal station at Macquarie Harbour, which set out on its maiden voyage in September 1822. As commander of the Waterloo and then the Cyprus, Kinghorne made the perilous voyage to Macquarie Harbour many times, bringing back Huon Pine, an excellent shipbuilding timber logged there by convicts. Later, as captain of the Prince Leopold, Kinghorne made voyages to Launceston and the Tamar River, again involved largely in transporting timber between settlements. Following the closure of Macquarie Harbour in 1834 and now in charge of the Isabella, Kinghorne remained engaged in convict-related work, transporting prisoners, passengers and goods between Hobart and Port Arthur, also making occasional trips to Sydney and New Zealand. Having made over 90 voyages as the captain of government vessels in Van Diemen's Land, Kinghorne left the service in 1840, moved to Jervis Bay and established a whaling station. In retirement he lived on his brother's property near Goulburn; he died there, unmarried and childless, in 1878. Thomas James Lempriere (1796-1852) was a colonial public servant, writer and amateur artist who came to Van Diemen's Land in 1822. In 1826, he was appointed to the Commissariat Department, working as the storekeeper for the penal settlements at Maria Island and Macquarie Harbour before transferring to Port Arthur in 1831. Lempriere took a keen interest in the landscape and natural history of the various places he visited and also developed some skill as a portraitist, painting surveyor George William Evans and Port Arthur commandant Charles O'Hara Booth. Kinghorne sat for this portrait during his visits to Port Arthur in the Isabella in March and April 1834. In June that year, Kinghorne returned to Hobart with the painting which is inscribed: 'Capt.

Following several years with the Victorian police force, in February 1860, he applied to join the transcontinental expedition being planned by the Royal Society of Victoria. According to one who endorsed his application, Burke was 'a most active man, and very strong ... kind and gentle in his manners'; but he was also moody, impulsive and possessed of wilfulness and ambition. Despite having no experience of exploration, Burke was appointed commander of the Victorian Exploring Expedition, which left Melbourne in August 1860. On reaching Menindee, New South Wales, in October, Burke decided to split the expedition, ignoring instructions to establish a base camp further north at Coopers Creek. Burke and seven others then continued north; but he split the party again in early December when they reached Coopers Creek, instructing four men to remain at the depot they made there while he, William Wills, John King and Charlie Gray made a bid for the Gulf of Carpentaria. Ultimately, they made it close enough to the coast to taste salt water, but with their progress obstructed by mangroves 'could not obtain a view of the open ocean'. On the terrible return to Coopers Creek, Gray died; Burke, Wills and King got back to the camp to find that the waiting party had left just nine hours earlier. Burke then decided to head for the settled districts of South Australia, this decision resulting in another missed opportunity for rescue. For several weeks, they remained on the creek, sometimes assisted in finding food by the local Aboriginal people. Burke died of starvation and exhaustion in June 1861, having reportedly asked King to leave him unburied on the desert ground, his pistol in his hand.

Neumayer, a member of the Royal Society of Victoria's Expedition Committee, encouraged Wills to join the expedition to the Gulf; he was duly appointed its surveyor, astronomer and third-in-command. Wills became Burke's lieutenant when clashes with the expedition leader resulted in the resignation of the man initially appointed to the post. A skilled bushman and navigator, Wills was modest, loyal, serious and self- disciplined and some have suggested that the expedition would not have ended so disastrously had Wills been more forthright in challenging Burke's decisions. Despite the awful trials of the expedition's final months, Wills continued to record meteorological and other observations in his diary up until the last. In late May 1861 Wills recorded: 'We are trying to live the best way we can, like the blacks, but find it hard work.' Wills was later left in camp while Burke and King went to find Aboriginal people to help them obtain food; he wrote his last letter on 29 June, reporting to his father that 'spirits are excellent', despite anticipating being able to survive only another four or five days. King, having left Burke dead, returned to find Wills in the same condition.

By his own admission, Scobie spent most of his school years 'playing the wag' and was ten years old when he first began working as a strapper and jockey. 'A fearless and dashing horseman' according to one account, he rode many races in regional Victoria and South Australia, winning his first race at age fifteen and notching up his first metropolitan win at Flemington in March 1880, a few months before his twentieth birthday. From 1882 to 1893 he trained and rode the winners of major horse jumping races, including the prestigious four-mile Grand National Steeplechase which he won in 1887 on his horse Blue Mountain - a stallion Scobie considered 'vile tempered' but also 'the best thing I ever had through my hands'. In the 1890s, Scobie consolidated his success as a trainer; between 1900 and 1939, his horses took out four Melbourne Cups, eight Victoria Racing Club Derbies, ten Bendigo Cups, twelve Ascot Vale Stakes and five South Australian Jockey Club Derbies. Scobie married Joan Shaw Patterson in 1888, and their two sons, Norman and Austin, both became horse trainers. Scobie was known for his exacting and attentive attitude to horse training and he continued training almost until his death. His ghost-written autobiography, My Life on the Australian Turf, was published in 1929.  Painter and printmaker Frederick Woodhouse Senior (1820-1909) came to Australia in 1858 to establish himself as an equine portraitist, the colonial taste for sports such as racing and hunting having created significant demand for paintings of champion horses. Woodhouse painted the portraits of every horse to win the Melbourne Cup between 1861 and 1891 and in addition produced paintings of prize-winning sheep, cattle and dogs. Woodhouse's paintings were often engraved for reproduction in papers such as the Town and Country Journal and Australasian Sketcher. He also worked as a designer of sporting trophies, collaborating with Geelong silversmith Edward Fischer, for example, to produce the first locally-made presentation Melbourne Cup in 1876. A founding member of the Victorian Academy of Arts, Woodhouse's business diminished as photography grew in popularity and availability. 'A Melbourne Cup always meant \u00a3100 to me', he was quoted as saying, 'but photography knocked me out. Now an owner can get a picture of his horse in a sixpenny weekly, or for nothing - wrapped around the meat'.

Advancing to the rank of lieutenant and then captain, Brisbane served in Britain, Europe and the West Indies, eventually achieving the rank of Brigadier-General in 1812 and receiving a knighthood in 1817. On the advice of his friend the Duke of Wellington, Brisbane was appointed governor of New South Wales in November 1820 and arrived in Sydney late the following year. As governor, Brisbane was mainly occupied by land and convict matters. But he also introduced economic and currency reforms, established a supreme court and opposed censorship of the press; and as the first patron of the New South Wales Agricultural Society oversaw experiments with crops such as tobacco, cotton, coffee and flax. During his governorship, the limits of settlement were extended considerably, most notably through his ordering the establishment of a penal outpost at Moreton Bay, achieved in 1824 at a site on the river that John Oxley had explored and named after Brisbane the previous year. Brisbane had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1812 for his contributions to navigation and astronomy, and consequently encouraged similar pursuits in the colony, building an observatory in the grounds of Government House at Parramatta. Described by Sir John Herschel as the 'founder of Australian science', Brisbane continued his scientific work after his return to Scotland, receiving the gold medal of the Astronomical Society in 1828 and ultimately cataloguing more than 7,000 stars.  Engraver Frederick Bromley (active 1832-1870) was from a family of printmakers active in Britain for much of the nineteenth century. Published in 1842, this work by Bromley is an engraving of a painting held in a private Scottish collection.

Walter Spong, her father, was a scene painter who had worked at the Theatre Royal in Bristol and at Drury Lane. Hired by the Brough and Boucicault Comedy Company, in 1888 he moved to Melbourne, where he quickly fell in with Arthur Streeton and Tom Roberts (who soon painted Hilda's mother, n\u00e9e Elizabeth Tweddell). Hilda first appeared on stage when she was fourteen. After taking some acting lessons, she made her speaking debut in 1891 in the Brough and Boucicault production of Dr Bill. In no time she was a great favourite with theatregoers, one of whom - spurred, no doubt, by the happy fact that 'Hilda' rhymed with 'St Kilda' - wrote a poem in praise of her appearances at the Bijou theatre. In 1892 Roberts wrote to Streeton that he had been 'down at Spong's on Sunday evening ... Miss S pouring out tea and looking very charming... Yes, she looked very pretty'. The following year, in which Hilda is thought to have persuaded Roberts to paint her, Walter Spong established a company to showcase his daughter's talents. On the basis of subsequent triumphs in Melbourne and New Zealand, in 1896 she left Australia to establish her career in London, making her Drury Lane debut in The Duchess of Coolgardie: A Romance of the Australian Gold Fields in September that year. Before long she moved to New York City, where she was to appear in fifty Broadway productions between 1898 and 1940. In all, she spent more than four decades on stage in England and the USA. After visiting Australia to perform before World War I, Hilda Spong went back to America; she last appeared on Broadway when she was sixty- five, some years before she died in Ridgefield, Connecticut.  Roberts's painting of Miss Spong as a pretty ing\u00e9nue was in the collection of Australian artist Kevin 'Pro' Hart when he died, and was purchased from the auction of his estate in 2008. In her mid-twenties Hilda Spong was painted by the great American portraitist, William Merritt Chase, who had seen her perform on Broadway.

Bonner's mother was a Jagera woman; his father was English. Born under a palm tree on Ukerebagh Island, Tweed Heads, he was educated by his grandmother, only attending school for two years in his mid-teens. He worked in labouring jobs including ringbarking, cane cutting, scrub clearing and herding stock before moving to Palm Island, where he lived for many years. There, he began his involvement in community affairs, joining the One People of Australia League, of which he was to be Queensland president from 1967 and national president from 1980. He joined the Liberal party after the Referendum of 1967. In 1971 the party invited him to fill a Senate vacancy; famously, soon after giving his maiden speech, he demonstrated his prowess with the boomerang on the Senate Lawn. He was elected a senator in four subsequent elections between 1972 and 1980. During his twelve-year term Bonner was Senate Deputy Chairman of Committees and served on the Joint Parliamentary Publications Committee, the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare, the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and the Joint House Committee. Along with environmentalist Harry Butler, he was Australian of the Year in 1979. After resigning from the Liberal Party in 1983 he served on the Board of Directors of the ABC for eight years, was a patron of World Vision and Amnesty International, and was a member of the council of Griffith University, from which he obtained an honorary doctorate in 1993. Robert Campbell Junior (1944-1993) a Ngaku/Dhunghutti man, grew up in Kempsey. Campbell's father was a boomerang maker and Campbell observed him at his craft, shaping wood and inscribing designs. Having attended the Burnt Bridge Mission School, from the age of fourteen Campbell worked in a series of menial jobs in Kempsey and Sydney. In the 1980s, after he had begun to paint in earnest, shows in Sydney and Melbourne brought him critical recognition; in 1987 he was the artist-in-residence at the University of Sydney and was commissioned to create a poster for the Bicentennial Authority. In the late 1980s he travelled to Ramingining in the Northern Territory; he found the experience of the traditional community totally new, and to a certain extent the visit influenced his subsequent work. Although it was completed over a relatively short period, his body of work now stands as a key graphic record of mid- to late-twentieth-century Indigenous experience.

Aged sixteen, he joined the Royal Navy, and six years later was appointed to Cook's third voyage as Master of HMS Resolution. Bligh's main task was to make charts, and on the voyage he honed the exceptional navigational skills that would become - along with volatility and authoritarianism - his best-known characteristics. Subsequently  promoted  to Lieutenant, he served in the West Indies before being appointed commander of HMS Bounty, which was to embark on a voyage to Tahiti to collect breadfruit plants for British settlements in the Caribbean. The Bounty left Portsmouth in December 1787 and arrived in Matavai Bay almost a year later. During the Bounty's subsequent five-month stay, many crew members became happily accustomed to Tahitian ways and formed relationships with local women - attachments cited by Bligh as the most likely cause of the mutiny, led by second-in-command Fletcher Christian, that took place three weeks after they sailed from Tahiti in April 1789. According to Bligh's account, he was dragged from his cabin at sunrise, bound and repeatedly threatened with death before being set adrift in the ship's launch with eighteen supporters. The voyage that ensued is considered one of history's most remarkable feats of seamanship, as Bligh, with minimal provisions and no maps, successfully navigated the open boat over 3000 miles to Timor, losing only one of his men and during the voyage charting part of the coast of Australia. Christian and the mutineers returned to Tahiti before sailing with eighteen companions to Pitcairn Island, where they burnt the Bounty at sea. Another fourteen mutineers were captured in Tahiti but some perished when the ship sent to apprehend them sank. Three of the ten mutineers eventually brought to trial in England were hanged. Honourably acquitted by the customary court martial that followed the loss of a ship, Bligh made a second, successful breadfruit- collecting voyage to Tahiti in the Providence between 1791 and 1793. In 1805, on the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks, Bligh was appointed governor of New South Wales, taking up the post in August 1806 with a brief to curb the trade in rum and the influence of powerful, wealthy colonists. Again, despite his general integrity, Bligh's abrasive manner and rigid adherence to orders created conflict over issues such as land, planning and convict labour. This led ultimately to Australia's first and only military coup, the so-called 'Rum Rebellion' of January 1808, wherein Bligh was deposed by the New South Wales Corps and held under house arrest in Sydney for more than a year. After returning to England in 1810, Bligh was eventually promoted to Vice Admiral. He died in London, survived by his six daughters. Robert Dodd (1748-1816) was a leading painter of maritime and military subjects. He lived and worked in London and exhibited with the Society of Artists and at the Royal Academy between 1782 and 1809. Dodd was also a printmaker, issuing many of his paintings as engravings. His works are characterised by their high drama and include detailed studies of famous ships, representations of naval actions, and battle scenes from the Napoleonic and American Revolutionary wars. His image of the Bounty mutiny is perhaps the best-known contemporary depiction of the incident and was published in the same year as Bligh's account of the event and his extraordinary voyage in the longboat. The image also contains a depiction of Fletcher Christian, who is standing atop the stern of the Bounty between two breadfruit trees.

In November 1789, he and another man, Colebee, were captured on the orders of Governor Arthur Phillip, who was under official instruction to establish amicable relations with Aboriginal people and who had resorted to kidnapping when less drastic methods of fostering interaction failed. Colebee soon escaped, but Bennelong - described as 'of good stature, and stoutly made, with a bold, intrepid countenance which bespoke defiance and revenge' - chose to remain with his captors for several months, readily learning English, adopting European ways and exchanging names with Phillip in order to establish a form of kinship with him. Bennelong became a canny intermediary between the two cultures and often successfully manipulated the governor's favour to his own advantage. The two remained on good terms after the spearing of Phillip at Manly in September 1790 - an incident which some historians believe was a ritual punishment of Phillip for Bennelong's imprisonment, along with other wrongs. Phillip, for his part, saw much value in the relationship and on his return to England in 1792 took Bennelong and his kinsman, Yemmerrawanne, with him in observance of the curious tradition of introducing Indigenous people into London society. Bennelong returned to Sydney in 1795. After some years, he left the Sydney Cove settlement and became the leader of a group of Aboriginal people living near Kissing Point on the Parramatta River, but was scorned by some members of the white community for choosing to return to his traditional lifestyle. In 1802, when a member of Nicolas Baudin's expedition suggested that he travel to France, Bennelong asserted that 'there was no better country than his own and that he did not wish to leave it'. Bennelong spent the latter years of his life at the riverside farm belonging to his friend, the ex-convict brewer, James Squire, and was buried in the garden there on his death in 1813.

In 1912 she went to London, spending seven years there and in Europe before marrying and setting up house in the Sydney harbourside suburb of Mosman in 1920. Based there for the rest of her life, though travelling extensively, she campaigned vigorously on behalf of modern art while bringing forth a large body of robust paintings and prints. A contemporary of Grace Cossington-Smith and Thea Proctor, Preston was one of the first artists to recognise the significance and aesthetic power of Indigenous Australian art, the influence of which can be seen in some of her own work. She also saw the beauty in the native flowers and trees from which Thea Proctor, for one, recoiled. Since the 1980s, many of Preston's works have numbered amongst the most recognisable images of Australian art, featuring on placemats, teatowels, cards, notebooks, scarves, calendars and posters.

She later edited the children's pages of the Town and Country Journal and the Illustrated Sydney News. She was twenty-four when her first and most famous novel, Seven Little Australians, was published. The novel, which was distinct for its Sydney suburban setting and its representation of typical Australian childhood experiences, was a blistering success, the first edition selling out within weeks and Turner's publisher immediately contracting her to produce a sequel, The Family at Misrule, which appeared in 1895. Turner married lawyer Herbert Curlewis in Sydney in April 1896; in 1903 they moved with their two children, Jean and Adrian, to Avenel, a house in Mosman that was Turner's home for the remainder of her life. Turner's output was considerable; between 1896 and 1928, when her last novel was published, she produced an average of one book each year, as well as writing regularly for newspapers and magazines. Though by the end of her career she had written thirty- four volumes of fiction in addition to poetry, plays, and prose, Ethel Turner's first novel remains the one she is famous for. Seven Little Australians has been translated into at least thirteen languages, performed as a stage play and made into a film, two television series and a musical.

The daughter of James Mangles - an East India Company director and Member of Parliament - Ellen was thirteen when she snared the attention of naval officer James Stirling (1791-1865), a family acquaintance. Described as 'adventurous, not yet introduced to the simpering ways of high society, well-educated, amusing and attractive', Ellen is held by family lore to have been appealing to Stirling for her energy and lack of affectation. They were married on her sixteenth birthday in September 1823 and their first child was born the following year. In 1827, Stirling was given command of a voyage commissioned with identifying a new site for a British garrison on the west Australian coast. On his return to London, he presented the Colonial Office with a case for the establishment of a settlement on the Swan River. He was appointed lieutenant-governor of the new colony and in early 1829 Ellen sailed with him to the place that became Perth. Ellen's unpretentious manner served her well in a colony that, for the early part of Stirling's tenure, was a dishevelled assortment of tents and timber houses. Stirling's surveyor-general, John Septimus Roe, considered her 'affable and unaffected' and her friend Georgiana Molloy wrote of Ellen as 'exceedingly amiable and pleasingly natural'. Ellen maintained a gentrified style of living and as the colony's pre-eminent lady presided at race meetings, hunts and other 'entertainments'. Her charm and youth are said to have reflected well on her husband, softening some of the criticism of his governorship. Ellen had seven children during her ten years in Western Australia and another three following her return to Britain. Sir Thomas Phillips (1770-1845) was one of Regency London's most prolific and fashionable portraitists. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1792 and by 1796 was primarily occupied with portraiture. Among his subjects were botanist Sir Joseph Banks; explorer Sir John Franklin; poets William Blake and Lord Byron; and scientist Michael Faraday. Records held by the National Portrait Gallery in London show that Ellen Stirling sat for Phillips just before she left for Australia, at which time she was several months pregnant with her second child. Her portrait was displayed in the Mangles family home in Surrey and remained in the possession of Ellen's descendants until acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in 2008.

Of their seven children, only three survived to adulthood; Martha died of tuberculosis in January 1853, aged thirty-one.

Born in Melbourne, Miller made his first class debut, aged eighteen, in 1937 and was selected to play Sheffield Shield for Victoria during the 1939-40 season. Being as useful a footballer as a batsman, Miller was recruited by St Kilda, ultimately playing fifty games over four seasons with the club between 1940 and 1946. He enlisted with the RAAF in early 1942 and was deployed to England on completing his pilot training later that year. Posted to an RAF squadron, Miller flew combat planes in missions against targets in Europe, experiences that later prompted his famous response to an interviewer's question about the pressures of Test cricket: 'Pressure is a Messerschmitt up your arse', he stated, 'playing cricket is not.' During the war, Miller played with an RAAF eleven in matches against British services teams and played in the Australian side for the 'Victory Tests' of 1945. His Test career commenced with his selection for the inaugural Test match against New Zealand in March 1946, with Miller taking 6 wickets for 6 runs in the first of his 55 test appearances. He retired in 1956 having made 2958 runs and taken 170 Test wickets for an average of 22.97. As notable for his charm and handsomeness as for his on-field prowess, Miller was an unpredictable opponent, reputedly more interested in sportsmanship than in winning or statistics. This characteristic is said to have caused him to clash with others - specifically, his captain during the 1948 'Invincibles' tour, Don Bradman. In addition to his military and civilian honours, Miller was inducted into the Australian and International Cricket Halls of Fame; and in 2000 was named in Cricket Australia's Team of the Century. Max Dupain OBE (1911-1992) was one of Australia's most successful photographers. He took up photography at age thirteen and was twenty-three when he set up his own studio in Sydney. His work during the 1930s encompassed portraits, fashion photography and advertising shots for clients such as David Jones, the ABC and the lifestyle magazine The Home. During the 1940s, he adopted a more documentary style and in the 1950s turned increasingly to architectural photography. Many of his images - such as The Sunbaker 1937 - have since become strongly associated with ideas about Australian identity and ways of life.

His first published poems appeared in the Border Watch in 1864. Invited to stand for the South Australian parliament, he was elected to the House of Assembly for the Victoria district, combining his duties with riding and versifying. He resigned in 1866, having bought land in Western Australia, which he stocked with sheep that failed to prosper. His first two volumes of poetry, Ashtaroth and Sea Spray and Smoke Drift, were both published in June 1867; neither brought him financial reward. The following year he rented livery stables in Ballarat, and joined the town's Light Horse troop. A number of injuries, the death of his only child and the failure of the stables reduced his health, although his reputation as a poet and horseman grew.

He was born on the way to Norfolk Island to a convict, Catherine Crowley, and D'Arcy Wentworth, who was travelling as the ship's doctor. His mother died when he was ten and he was educated in England, where he was acknowledged by his father's elevated connections. Returning to Sydney in 1810, he gained a government job and a grant of land on the Nepean. In 1813 he crossed the Blue Mountains with William Lawson and Gregory Blaxland, an expedition that not only led to the opening up of huge areas of New South Wales for grazing, but saw Wentworth personally rewarded with further acreage. In England and Europe for eight years, he studied law and wrote a tract promoting emigration to the Australian colonies. He had already written a number of anonymous pieces criticising prominent figures, and on his return to Sydney in 1824, he co-founded the colony's first  independent  newspaper, the Australian, which attacked Governor Darling, campaigned for representative government and trial by jury, and championed the emancipists against the exclusives, whom Wentworth characterised as 'the yellow snakes of the colony'. In the late 1820s he defended himself scintillatingly against libel charges. A huge landowner and popular hero by 1831, he threw a party for 4000 people at his home in Vaucluse at the end of Darling's term. In the 1830s he prepared several drafts of an amended constitution for the colony, which had long been his dream. A member of the Legislative Council from 1843, between 1848 and 1850 Wentworth moved to set up state primary education, and also to establish the University of Sydney. He chaired the select committee that drafted a constitution for a self-governing New South Wales in 1853. Having made a fundamental contribution to the subsequent shape of Australian democracy, for his last eighteen years he lived mostly in England.

By 1905, he was the store's advertising manager; he became a director in 1906, when David Jones Limited became a public company, and was to be its chairman from 1920 to 1958, as the store expanded in Sydney and then across the country. A cofounder of Art in Australia and The Home in the 1920s, he was a trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales for twenty-four years and established the David Jones Art Gallery. He took a keen interest in music, and amongst his many other public positions was the first chairmanship of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, in 1932. That year, as a member of the Board of Control of the new Australian National Travel Association, Jones gave a lecture on 'Selling Australia to the World', a topic which remained of vital interest to him. The Travel Association arranged for the production and overseas distribution of posters and booklets showing Australia's scenery, flora and fauna, and produced a booklet, 'Talking Points', available to any Australian travelling abroad, suggesting conversational gambits that would shed favourable light on the country. Jones persisted with his own painting, and exhibited often with the Society of Artists. Meanwhile, he built up a very significant collection of paintings by other artists. He lived at Rosemont in Ocean Street, Woollahra, and was a genial member of several clubs. William Dobell (1899-1970) painted Jones the year he was knighted, during the six-year period in which he was commodore of the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron (by the time he took up the position, in 1949, he had been sailing out of the Squadron for forty-six years).

'It was an old wartime First World War aeroplane', she recalled, 'and it seemed to have a magnetic attraction for me'. At seventeen, she went to Sydney to have flying lessons with Charles Kingsford Smith, paying for her helmet, leathers and goggles with the money she'd saved from working in her father's general store. She obtained her commercial pilot's licence in 1935 and was hired as the pilot for the Far West Children's Health Scheme. Using a road map to navigate (there were no aviation maps available), she flew nurses and doctors to patients in remote areas. Certain male aviators declared that a woman would never last in such a role, yet Bird Walton flew this aerial ambulance service - first in north-west New South Wales and later in Queensland - without giving a thought to the perils of her work: 'You learnt to fly an aeroplane and you went out and did a job', she said. In 1938, the Dutch airline, KLM, invited her to Europe for promotional work and to study the aviation industry. She met Englishman, Charles Walton, on her return journey home. They married in Sydney in 1939 in a ceremony conducted by John Flynn, whose innovations led to the forming of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. During the war, she was a commandant in the Women's Air Training Corps; and in 1950 she founded the Australian Women Pilots' Association, which subsequently encouraged many to defy the notion that women were unsuited to careers in aviation. She was awarded an OBE in 1966, an AO in 1990, and named a National Living Treasure in 1997. Her 1990 autobiography, My God, It's a woman!, took its title from one cattle station owner's reaction to her diminutive, feminine frame emerging from the cockpit on landing on a remote airstrip. She died at her home in Sydney in January 2009, aged ninety-three. Judy Cassab (b. 1920) was commissioned to paint a portrait of Nancy Bird Walton's husband, Charles, in 1973. It was such a success, the couple commissioned this portrait, which was in Bird Walton's possession until she donated it to the National Portrait Gallery in 2008.

His interest in theological education and work on behalf of the Church Missionary Society resulted in his being nominated for the position of bishop for the diocese of Melbourne. When Perry arrived in Melbourne in 1848 the diocese had a population of 43,000 and its pastoral work was handled by three chaplains based in Melbourne, Geelong and Portland. Supporting the participation of lay people in the church, Perry alleviated this shortage of clergy by appointing colonists as readers. In 1850, along with five other Australasian bishops, Perry advocated self-governance of the Australian Anglican Church, leading to the establishment of the first synod of the Anglican Church in Australia in 1856. In the mid- 1860s, following the extraordinary population growth created by the gold rush, Perry put a case for the subdivision of his diocese, leading to the creation of the Ballarat diocese in 1873. Perry also made strong contributions to the establishment of the Melbourne Grammar School and the Geelong Grammar School. While he was considered a traditionalist, he lectured frequently in the 1860s on the need for the Church to engage with new scientific theories. Contemporaries described Perry as a paradoxical figure, who could be affectionate and confiding as well as severe, stern and uncompromising in his doctrinal beliefs.

He was admitted to the Bar in 1857 and later the same year married Mary Bolton (1837-1912) who, after raising their nine children, established her own profile as a philanthropist and women's rights campaigner. Influenced in part by the experiences of his mother, who as a widow had retained and managed the family estate, Windeyer too developed a particular interest in women's rights. This interest was expressed in his (sometimes controversial) judicial compassion for female victims of male violence; in his support for matters such as divorce law reform; and in his introduction of the Married Women's Property Act (1879), which enabled women to retain control of assets they brought to or earned within a marriage. Windeyer first entered Parliament in June 1859, serving in the Legislative Assembly as the member for Lower Hunter until 1860 and then representing West Sydney and the University of Sydney at different periods until 1879. Retiring from politics after two and a half years as attorney- general, Windeyer was appointed to the bench of the Supreme Court. Windeyer was also a strong supporter of education and throughout his career maintained an association with Sydney University: he was vice- chancellor between 1883 and 1886, chancellor in 1895-96 and a founding chairman of the Women's College, established in 1891. Windeyer received an honorary doctorate from the University of Cambridge in 1887 and a knighthood in 1891.

In 1805, having taken up a land grant on the Hawkesbury, he was appointed Superintendent of Public Works and moved to Parramatta. His loyalty to the deposed governor William Bligh saw him removed from this position. He was reinstated by Lachlan Macquarie, and oversaw the construction of many public buildings including the Parramatta Hospital and renovations to Government House. His loyalty to Macquarie was rewarded with another land grant of 450 acres near Windsor. This property, Rouse Hill, became the cornerstone of the family's farming operations which were extended in the 1820s by a grant of 4 000 acres (later named Guntawang) on the Cudgegong River, near Gulgong. By 1828 Rouse owned land in Bathurst, Mudgee, Wellington, Lithgow and the Hunter Valley, as well as properties in Richmond and Penrith. With the assistance of his sons, Rouse ran these properties from Rouse Hill and bred sheep, cattle and thoroughbreds. He was described as 'an old and much respected colonist' on his death at the age of seventy- nine, 'a devoted family man, loyal member of the Church of England, a hard-working and honest public servant, and a very efficient grazier'. These portraits are copies of those commissioned from artist William Griffith in 1847. Trained in France, Griffith (c. 1808-1870) came to the colony in 1840.

Born in Germany, Rodius had spent several years in Paris where he studied and worked as a teacher of 'music, painting, drawing and languages in families of the first distinction'. He then went to England where, in early 1829, he was convicted of stealing a lady's handbag and sentenced to transportation to New South Wales for seven years. On arrival in Sydney, Rodius was immediately employed as an architectural draughtsman and drawing teacher by the Department of Public Works. He also gave drawing lessons to children of prominent residents of Sydney. Such social connections, combined with his urbanity and talent, had the effect of tempering his anomalous convict status and Rodius secured the patronage of many of the settlement's citizens. Some of these patrons supported Rodius in his application for exemption from government service and when this was granted in 1832 he began to earn an independent living as an artist. While he also created landscapes or 'views', portraiture formed the most substantial part of Rodius's output and his work in the genre resulted in a vivid record of the character of colonial Sydney. His sitters came from within the ranks of the law, politics and business as well as from the trade, landowning and ex-convict sectors of society. Many of his portraits - typically executed in pencil, charcoal and pastel, or 'French crayon' - were also issued as lithographs, such as his 1846 likeness of explorer Ludwig Leichhardt; and his portraits of Aboriginal people from the Sydney, Broken Bay and Shoalhaven districts, created in the 1830s and 1840s. Rodius received his certificate of freedom in 1841 by which time he was a successful artist. After two short- lived marriages - the first, in 1834, to a seamstress named Maria Bryant; and the second to Harriet Taylor, who died in 1838 - Rodius made his third in 1841 to Harriet Allen, the daughter of another ex-convict artist, Josiah Allen. Long rumoured to exist but concealed from the notice of art historians in the private collection of a descendant, this self portrait is held by family lore to have been made by Rodius to kill time while Harriet gave birth to their daughter, Theresa, in an adjoining room. In 1856, Rodius suffered a stroke that left him partly paralysed and unable to continue working as an artist. He died in April 1860, aged fifty-eight.

Melbourne- born, Douglas joined the Royal Australian Air Force as a technician in 1921 and graduated as a pilot six years later. In April 1929, he flew to the Northern Territory as part of a team looking for the crew of a plane called the Kookaburra, which had crashed while itself taking part in a search for aviators Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm. Douglas was recommended for the Air Force Medal for his part in the mission and promoted to pilot officer, and later the same year was appointed to take part in the BANZARE voyages. Along with flight-lieutenant Stuart Campbell, Douglas - and the Gypsy Moth seaplane he referred to as 'our machine' - played a significant role in the expedition's scientific and exploratory activities, flying ahead of expedition ship Discovery to identify routes through the pack ice, identifying sites for landings, and making 'flights for photographs - both cine and still' with official photographer Frank Hurley and his thirty-pound cinema camera. In a paper published in 1932, Mawson acknowledged that 'the aeroplane proved a most important factor in the prosecution of the  geographical program. Its successful operation, at times under most difficult conditions, [owed] everything to the determination and skill of Campbell and Douglas'. In 1935 Douglas returned to Antarctica to search for the missing American explorer Lincoln Ellsworth and his pilot Herbert Hollick-Kenyon. Awarded the Polar Medal for his part in the BANZARE expedition, Douglas returned to military service in the 1930s and retired from the RAAF in 1948.  Best known for his dramatic, heroic images of Antarctic ice and seascapes, Douglas's colleague Frank Hurley also took many photographs depicting his shipmates and their daily activities. This informal portrait of Eric Douglas - who considered Hurley 'a great chap to be away with' - depicts him on the deck of the Discovery and clad in his expedition-issue woollen socks, jumper and beanie. 'You don't worry what you look like or how you dress', Douglas wrote, 'and I think a spell like this does us all good'.

As a student, he drew on principles he had learned while working for his father, a demanding self-made man who had a number of building businesses in Sydney after the war. Having graduated in 1961, Murcutt worked with several leading Sydney architects before establishing his own practice in Mosman in 1969. He was awarded both the Royal Australian Institute of Architects' Gold Medal, and the Alvar Aalto medal in 1992; he received the American Institute of Architects' Gold Medal in 2009. Murcutt is unusual amongst the world's most highly-awarded architects in that he works alone, mostly on residential homes; he has never made a skyscraper; and he uses mostly basic materials. He uses shades, louvres, fully opening walls and carefully planned ventilation to enable his buildings to respond instantly to changing conditions and requirements. His overriding design philosophy is that dwellings should 'touch the earth lightly'.

Keen for the portrait to accord with the personal style of his khaki-clad sitter (he says wryly that the top of his friend's head reminds him of the curve of a typical Murcutt roof), the artist kept the work very simple. The details of the architect's face are reduced to lidless and browless eyes, nose and lips; the water is reflected in his signature half-spectacles. Floating in the blue sky over his head are the sun and moon, which sit beneath the architect's name like golden medals or seals.

Having achieved great success in this field - he won a Cannes Gold Lion in 1967 - he gave it up to paint full- time in 1980, working from a 'cabin' below his home at Chinaman's Beach on Sydney Harbour. Soon, his paintings of Sydney's beaches, harbour, animals and flowers became the creative source for his range of placemats, t-shirts, bibs, swimwear, bedlinen, mugs and vases, marketed as Done Designs. By 1987, Done had an annual turnover of more than $4 million from his instantly- identifiable branded products. In 1992, he was made a Member of the Order of Australia for tripartite services: to art, design and tourism. The success of his merchandise has been plausibly linked with Sydney's rapid rise to an international holiday destination by the beginning of the 1990s. The genial artist was named Australia's Father of the Year in 1989 and Mosman Citizen of the Year in 1993 and he was Australia's Goodwill Ambassador to UNICEF in 1993.

Ken Done has painted self portraits in various styles. Me is executed in his customarily riotous palette. There are spots and stripes; the nose is a cord of yellow paint straight from the tube. The three eyes are portals to the cubist character of the self portrait, in which Done has merged a profile with a full face representation. Although he has painted his trademark moustache only once, two smiles traverse it, one in full face, a red banana shape, and one in profile, its yellow outlines loosely containing a few slashes of white teeth. The Harbour Bridge sits on his forehead like a set of patriotic wrinkles. The Opera House, on his cheek, has been a boon for Done. He says 'I've drawn [it] straight. I've painted it in white, yellow, blue, pink, magenta, emerald, turquoise... purple and black. I've painted it soft, hard edged, ethereal, misty, blatant and bold. Upside-down, sideways and inside out.' Done describes Me as at least in part a painting about the difficulty of painting.

A talented amateur artist and connoisseur, he was on the organising committee for the first art exhibitions held in Tasmania in the mid-1840s, and held a solo exhibition of his own watercolour landscapes in 1858.

Despite his having led them through disastrous Western Front actions, Birdwood won far more respect from Australian soldiers than did most British senior commanders. In 1930, King George V said that he believed he would make an excellent governor-general, 'the more so since after my close association with the Australian troops many people had come to believe that I was an Australian by birth, and not simply by adoption', as Birdwood wrote.

Johann Forster was not a natural seaman, and his journal paints a sensitive picture of the hardships of the expedition as well as the peoples, animals and plants encountered on its course. The Admiralty barred Johann from publishing on the trip, but George wrote an outstanding scientific account of it that became a bestseller. Henceforth the Forsters were renowned as the European experts on the Pacific. George's essay 'Neuholland und die brittische Kolonie in Botany-Bay' (1786) was an upbeat description of the geography, Indigenous inhabitants and resources of the nascent colony, for which he predicted a bright future. His long essay Cook, der Entdecker (Cook, the Discoverer), published in 1787 as the introduction to his German translation of the account of Cook's third, fatal voyage, was the first major contemporary assessment of James Cook, and it remains the only substantial account of the great man by someone who knew him well. Though only recently published in English, Cook, the Discoverer is now recognised as the starting point for the vast academic and popular enterprise that Cook scholarship has since become.

In Samoa eleven of the Astrolabe's crew were killed, but he made no reprisals. He was seen off the coast of Botany Bay on 24 January 1788, and came ashore two days later. After staying six weeks in the area that now bears his name, he sailed away - never to be seen again.  A search led by Bruny d'Entrecasteaux in 1791 proved fruitless; only in 1828 was it established that he had wrecked at Santa Cruz. The four-volume Voyage De La P\u00e9rouse Autour du Monde, the account of his journey as far as Kamchatka, was published in Paris in 1797 and translated into English a few years later.

Kidman ran away from his Adelaide home as a boy. Finding work with an itinerant cattleman, he learned much about bushcraft from an Aboriginal man he befriended. After working for a couple of years as a rouseabout and stockman around Broken Hill, he bought a bullock team and began carting supplies between isolated settlements in NSW and Victoria. In the early 1870s he established a butcher's shop in Cobar that was successful enough for him to set up as a large squatter, dealing cattle and horses to add to the income he was earning from his coach transport enterprises in New South Wales and Western Australia. In the 1880s he bought his first station, in the Northern Territory; over the following twelve years he built up two giant chains of properties stretching across vast tracts of country that enabled him to move stock where rain had fallen. By World War I he held land almost equal in area to that of Victoria. He contributed substantially to the armed forces during the war and was knighted in 1921, the day after he donated his country home, Eringa, to the South Australian government. In the mid-1920s, he weathered a land-tax evasion case that dragged on for three years; by 1927, according to historian Russel Ward, his name had come to signify 'a complex of interlocking companies, partnerships and agencies with branches in all the mainland capital cities and some country towns'. By the time he died, Kidman was internationally famous as one of the world's biggest landowners; this drawing was made to accompany an article about him in the New York Herald Tribune in July 1932.  Samuel Johnson Woolf, American painter, lithographer and illustrator, was born in New York City. He studied with Kenyon Cox and George de Forest Brush at the Art Students' League and the National Academy of Design. In World War I he worked in Europe as a frontline artist-correspondent for Time magazine. In this capacity he painted portraits of General John C Pershing, commanding general of the US forces, and French general Joseph Joffre amongst others. Other subjects of portraits by Woolf include Franklin D Roosevelt, Josef Stalin and Edgar Allen Poe. Renowned for extracting confidences from his sitters as he worked, Woolf wrote several volumes of reminiscences including Drawn from Life (1932) and Hear I Am (1942).

Throughout the 1930s, Dupain established his reputation with portraiture and advertising work and gained exposure in the lifestyle magazine The Home. Between 1939 and 1941, Dupain and Cotton were married and she photographed him often; her Max After Surfing is frequently cited as one of the most sensuous Australian portrait photographs. While Dupain was on service during World War II Cotton ran his studio, one of very few professional women photographers in Australia. Cotton remarried in 1944 and moved to her husband's property near Cowra, New South Wales. Although busy with a farm, a family, and a teaching position at the local high school, Cotton continued to take photographs and opened a studio in Cowra in 1964. In the 1950s, Dupain turned increasingly to architectural photography, collaborating with architects and recording projects such as the construction of the Sydney Opera House. Dupain continued to operate his studio on Sydney's Lower North Shore until he died at the age of 81. Cotton was in her seventies when her work again became the subject of attention. In 1983, she was awarded a Visual Arts Board grant to reprint negatives that she had taken over a period of forty years or more.

A regular contributor to the Bulletin in the 1890s, he supported its nationalist, egalitarian and pro-union stance. In that decade, too, he wrote scores of stories and vignettes, the best of them - such as 'The Drover's Wife' and 'The Bush Undertaker' -  haunting, profoundly sad and wryly funny all at once. Despite catastrophic bouts of depression and alcoholism that turned him into a shambling, suicidal wraith, Lawson continued to write until his death in Sydney at the age of fifty-five, when he was honoured with a State funeral.  Sir Lionel Lindsay (1874-1961) was a productive watercolourist, etcher, wood engraver, black and white artist and book illustrator as well as a vocal art critic. One of ten children, five of whom became professional artists, he made many etchings and engravings of Sydney architecture and of Australian birds and animals. He used to see Lawson on the Sydney ferries, in bookshops and in pubs around the Bulletin office, recalling that 'Henry whenever he met you, would pull up very erect and salute with a pleasant, wild smile'. Lindsay drew Lawson often. 'He was a splendid sitter', he wrote, 'and seemed rather to like putting in time this way. But I have no recollections of our conversation; though I remember his excitement about an illustration I had made for one of his stories.

While a student at the Royal College of Science, he was appointed to the position of Assistant Geological Surveyor to the New South Wales government. He arrived in Sydney in late 1882 and over the next several years completed important surveys, particularly relating to coal deposits in the Hunter Valley. In the midst of this, he married teacher Caroline Mallett and the first of their three children was born. He was appointed Professor of Geology at University of Sydney in 1891 although he continued to devote much of his time to fieldwork. He was awarded the Bigsby Medal by the Royal Society in 1904 for his work on coral atolls; and by 1906 was also a recognised authority on glaciation. Consequently, he was invited by Ernest Shackleton to join the British Antarctic Expedition, conducted between 1907 and 1909, during the course of which he led the first successful ascent of Mount Erebus and also a four-month, 1,250 kilometre sled journey to the Magnetic South Pole. He was accompanied in this feat by his former student, Douglas Mawson, who had been appointed physicist to the expedition at Edgeworth David's instigation. During World War I, Edgeworth David served as a major in the AIF, advising on ground water and the design and siting of trenches and tunnels on the Western Front. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1918 and promoted to lieutenant-colonel. He was knighted in 1920, and thereafter devoted himself to the writing of a comprehensive account of the geology of Australia, which was published two years before his death. Edgeworth David is depicted in this work with the Canadian-born Arctic explorer and anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson (1879-1962), who was an associate of Edgeworth David, Douglas Mawson, Hubert Wilkins, Thomas Griffith Taylor and other Australian scientists and explorers.

Ronald 'Bon' Scott (1946-1980) had come to Australia with his family in 1952, aged six; had lived in Melbourne and Fremantle, where he joined a pipe band; had dropped out of school at fifteen; and had spent some time in custody. By 1974, Scott was working at a fertiliser plant by day and writing songs at night. Artistic differences had arisen between AC/DC and their lead singer, Dave Evans, and Scott had had a terminal falling-out with his own loose group, the Mount Lofty Rangers. He liked AC/DC but thought they were too young to rock; they thought he was too old to rock; but their first jam session was enough to ratify the first AC/DC lineup. The following year, with two albums and four huge singles in Australia, the band was signed to an international deal, but American success did not come until Highway to Hell reached number 17 on the US charts in 1979. Bon told Rennie Ellis in 1978 that he could see no end to it, but two years later he was dead, having inhaled his own vomit while 'sleeping off' a bender in a parked car in London. His grave in Fremantle is the most-visited grave in Australia. Largely thanks to Angus Young's star status, AC/DC weathered the loss of Scott and his replacement by Brian Johnston.

As a boy, Mai had fled Raiatea when it was attacked by people from the neighbouring island of Bora Bora. He took refuge in Tahiti and then Huahine, where Cook and Furneaux met him in 1773. On board the Adventure, Mai was tutored in English language and manners by the ship's second lieutenant, James Burney, who described him as being 'possessed of many great qualities'. Arriving at Spithead in 1774, Mai met with Lord Sandwich, First Lord of the Admiralty, and was placed in the care of Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, who, with Burney, were among the few able to communicate with him. Banks installed Mai in his London residence; paid his bills for such things as clothes, wine and servants; and, with Solander, presented him to King George III and Queen Charlotte. While in London, Mai was introduced to such eminent figures as Samuel Johnson and Burney's sister, Fanny, the novelist and diarist. Mai's bearing and social skills made him a great success and he was embraced by London society as an embodiment of popular notions of the charm and sensuality of the South Seas. Mai also sat for his portrait to artists including Sir Joshua Reynolds and Nathaniel Dance, whose splendid representations of his 'tall and very well made' frame were then issued as engravings, evincing Mai's appeal to the worldly eighteenth century imagination and the currency of ideas regarding the 'Noble Savage'. For Mai, however, the London sojourn had a clear political agenda: to seek British support (and firearms) for a war by which he hoped to reclaim Raiatea from its invaders. Supplied with muskets and gunpowder among various other items, Mai sailed home with Cook when the navigator left on his third voyage in 1776. Fearing bloodshed should Mai return to Raiatea, Cook settled him on Huahine. Mai died there two years later.

Aged sixteen, he joined the Royal Navy, and six years later was appointed to Cook's third voyage as Master of HMS Resolution. Bligh's main task was to make charts, and on the voyage he honed the exceptional navigational skills that would become - along with volatility and authoritarianism - his best-known characteristics. Subsequently  promoted  to Lieutenant, he served in the West Indies before being appointed commander of HMS Bounty, which was to embark on a voyage to Tahiti to collect breadfruit plants for British settlements in the Caribbean. The Bounty left Portsmouth in December 1787 and arrived in Matavai Bay almost a year later. During the Bounty's subsequent five-month stay, many crew members became happily accustomed to Tahitian ways and formed relationships with local women - attachments cited by Bligh as the most likely cause of the mutiny, led by second-in-command Fletcher Christian, that took place three weeks after they sailed from Tahiti in April 1789. According to Bligh's account, he was dragged from his cabin at sunrise, bound and repeatedly threatened with death before being set adrift in the ship's launch with eighteen supporters. The voyage that ensued is considered one of history's most remarkable feats of seamanship, as Bligh, with minimal provisions and no maps, successfully navigated the open boat over 3000 miles to Timor, losing only one of his men and during the voyage charting part of the coast of Australia. Christian and the mutineers returned to Tahiti before sailing with eighteen companions to Pitcairn Island, where they burnt the Bounty at sea. Another fourteen mutineers were captured in Tahiti but some perished when the ship sent to apprehend them sank. Three of the ten mutineers eventually brought to trial in England were hanged. Honourably acquitted by the customary court martial that followed the loss of a ship, Bligh made a second, successful breadfruit- collecting voyage to Tahiti in the Providence between 1791 and 1793. In 1805, on the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks, Bligh was appointed governor of New South Wales, taking up the post in August 1806 with a brief to curb the trade in rum and the influence of powerful, wealthy colonists. Again, despite his general integrity, Bligh's abrasive manner and rigid adherence to orders created conflict over issues such as land, planning and convict labour. This led ultimately to Australia's first and only military coup, the so-called 'Rum Rebellion' of January 1808, wherein Bligh was deposed by the New South Wales Corps and held under house arrest in Sydney for more than a year. After returning to England in 1810, Bligh was eventually promoted to Vice Admiral. He died in London, survived by his six daughters.

Having spent the first five years of a seven year sentence in Newgate Prison and then on a hulk at Woolwich, Fitzgerald soon earned his freedom and by 1802 was working as inspector and director of all of the farms belonging to government.

She returned to Australia briefly in 1910, completing a number of portrait commissions here and holding exhibitions in Sydney and Melbourne from which works were acquired by the National Galleries of Victoria and New South Wales.

When Marjorie Lawrence visited Brisbane on a concert tour in 1944, she urged him to take his singing further. In March 1945 he sang on Australia's Amateur Hour and gained a record number of votes. Rejected elsewhere, he was finally accepted by the Melbourne (Melba) Conservatorium of Music, gaining his diploma in 1949. Having scraped up the means to study in New York, he performed in a benefit concert in the New York Town Hall in early 1951; some months later, he appeared as a guest artist for the ABC's Jubilee Tour of Australia. Returning to Melbourne, he worked in a department store and in 1956 began to teach part-time at the conservatorium. After spending 1959 in Europe, he became the proprietor of a service station and later of a milk bar. A member of the Aborigines' Welfare Board in Victoria in the late 1950s, Blair was also involved in the Aborigines Advancement League, the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the Commonwealth Aboriginal Arts Board and initiated the successful Aboriginal Children's Holiday Project. In 1964 he stood to no avail as Labor candidate for Mentone; three years later he began work as a school music teacher. In 1973, three years before he died, he won praise for his performance in the opera Dalgerie, at the Sydney Opera House.  Ernest Buckmaster (1897-1968) grew up in country Victoria, where his facility for art was recognised early on. He served an apprenticeship as a signwriter and later, from 1918 to 1924, studied under Bernard Hall and WB McInnes at the National Gallery School in Melbourne. He exhibited regularly with the Victorian Artists Society from 1919, and from the time of his first Sydney exhibition at the Macquarie Galleries in 1927 he was commissioned as a portraitist. With a remarkable seventy-two portraits hung in the Archibald Prize between 1924 and 1966, he won the Prize in 1932 with a portrait of Sir William Irvine, the lieutenant-governor of Victoria. In August 1945, he was appointed an official war artist and sent to Singapore, where, for the Military History Section, he documented the repatriation of POWs and other activities subsequent to the Japanese surrender.

In 1888, Chambers's reputation was established when his play Captain Swift was staged with Herbert Tree in the lead role. The play about a bushranger grabbed by 'the long arm of coincidence' was to be his only Australian-themed work apart from Thumb-nail sketches of Australian life (1891). For three decades he worked on twenty or so plays, which were staged in the West End and sometimes in New York; his outstanding successes included The fatal card (1894), The tyranny of tears (1899), Passers-by (1911) and The saving grace (1917). Handsome, graceful and a scintillating conversationalist, he was courted by society hostesses and prominent in club life.

Selected by the Wesleyan Mission of London as a missionary to the Aboriginal people of the Port Phillip district, he arrived in Australia in March 1838 with his wife, Sarah (n\u00e9e Gilbart c. 1808-1854), staying briefly in Hobart before proceeding to Melbourne. He undertook a number of journeys around the Geelong and Colac districts - some with the 'wild white man' William Buckley as his interpreter - to find a place for the establishment of a mission, ultimately settling on a site on the Barwon River near Birregurra where he established the Buntingdale Mission in 1839. Tuckfield declared his aim 'to induce the natives to abandon their erratic habits ... in order that we may teach them the arts of civilised life.' Sarah supported Francis through her work as the mission's nurse and teacher, while also raising the six children she bore between 1838 and 1846. Despite Tuckfield's zeal, the mission struggled to either convert the local Aboriginal people or convince them to stay at the station. His efforts at 'civilising' large numbers were also hampered by the worsening impact of tribal strife and of European settlement and disease on the Aboriginal population. The station closed in 1848. Sarah had two more children while they lived in Geelong between 1848 and 1850. For the next three years they were in Sydney, where Francis ministered at the York Street Chapel. In the early days of the next phase of her husband's career, in Maitland, Sarah died. Her death notice referred to a protracted and painful affliction, which she bore with exemplary patience. From 1856 to 1860, Tuckfield worked in West Hobart and New Norfolk, married again and fathered a further four children with his second wife, Mary Stevens.

When he was eleven, spurred by a schoolmate, he asked the couple he believed to be his parents why he was black and they were white; they told him his birth parents had died in a house fire. His foster sister introduced him to the guitar and keyboards, and he began to play American country songs. At the age of fifteen, he was contacted by his natural sister, who told him their birth mother had just died. Bitterly, he took to the road, to spend the next fourteen years on the streets, fighting and drinking. He met his lifelong partner, Ruby Hunter, at a Salvation Army drop-in centre when she was sixteen. Having had children with her, and having beaten his alcohol dependency, he wrote his first song, 'Took the Children Away', which he performed in Melbourne on community radio and an Indigenous current affairs program in 1988. He was invited to open a Paul Kelly concert in early 1989; his performance was met with stunned silence, followed by shattering applause. Kelly produced Roach's first album, Charcoal Lane (1990), for which Roach won two ARIAs and a human rights award. Charcoal Lane was on the US Rolling Stone's Top 50 albums for 1992 and achieved gold sales in Australia. Six more albums followed before Into the Bloodstream, released in 2012.

Banks grew up on his father's Lincolnshire estate and sharpened his interest in botany at Eton and Oxford. At the age of twenty-five, he suggested to the council of the Royal Society that they recommend him for inclusion on the voyage of the Endeavour, commanded by James Cook. On the three-year trip, he and Daniel Solander collected hundreds of specimens of plants and animals of the South Seas. For the rest of his life Banks was one of the sparkling stars of Enlightenment London. It was he who endorsed New South Wales as a site for a penal settlement; he was a patron of Matthew Flinders and others; and he corresponded zestfully with all the early governors of New South Wales. From 1788 to about 1810, though Banks held no official post (there was no 'master plan' for the settlement of the Colony, nor Department to administer it) he was a continuous advocate for the colony and his role as effective head of Australian affairs was widely acknowledged. Late in life, Banks's chief interests were the development of superior sheep varieties and the drainage of the Lincolnshire fens to create pasture. It is largely down to Banks's personal enthusiasm for merino sheep that specimens of the breed were established in Australia within a couple of decades of English settlement. John Macarthur was able to purchase seven rams and three ewes at the first public auction of merinos, supervised by Banks, near the Pagoda at Kew Gardens on 15 August 1804. Six of the beasts survived to land at Sydney on 7 July 1805. As a result, in years to come, England's irksome dependence on European wool would be eased. Benjamin West (1738-1820) began his painting of Banks in 1771-72, about five months after Banks returned from his fabulous trip to the Pacific. Now housed in Lincolnshire, West's life-sized portrait shows the twenty-nine- year-old Banks surrounded by, and draped in, souvenirs of his voyage. John Raphael Smith's (1752-1812) mezzotint print of the painting was first issued by Hooper and Smith in 1773. Smith was a draper's assistant and miniature painter before turning to engraving in London. He was appointed engraver to the Prince of Wales; he engraved about forty works of Joshua Reynolds's; he ran a print dealership; and he created some excellent portraits in crayon. He was learned, and a brilliant raconteur, and his body of work included some of the finest eighteenth-century English engravings; yet his 'dissipated habits' militated against his prosperity, and he died with his career on a steep downward trajectory in Doncaster.

Not long after, he became known to Joseph Banks, and in 1768 he and Banks together applied to the King to obtain berths on James Cook's Endeavour. Having barely survived the dysentery that killed many of the Endeavour's crew, Solander returned to England to be fted along with Banks for his scientific achievements. When Banks withdrew from Cook's second voyage, Solander followed suit; the pair went to Iceland and the Western Isles before Solander settled into the role of Banks's librarian and curator in London. Though he produced some significant treatises - including the first scientific account of the kangaroo - he gained a reputation for partying at the expense of cataloguing specimens.

Coached in Sydney by Harry Hopman, nicknamed 'Muscles' on account of his slight stature, he won his first major titles, the Australian and French singles, in 1953 at the age of eighteen. At the close of the 1977 season, aged forty-three, he was still ranked number 12 in the game. Altogether, Rosewall won 18 major titles in singles, doubles and mixed, the sixth-highest male total. He won the US open in 1956 and again in 1970. There were twenty years between the first of his four Wimbledon finals, in 1954, and his last, in 1974, and nineteen years between his first Australian title in 1953 and his last in 1972 (he remains both the youngest person to win the title, and the oldest). Rosewall turned professional in 1957 and in due course became the second player (after Rod Laver) to earn more than a million dollars from tennis, but the ban on professionals from 1957 to 1967 precluded his participation in many Grand Slam events. Wimbledon was the only big singles title that eluded him, although he won the doubles with Lew Hoad in 1953 and 1956 (in 1968 the Wimbledon men's doubles was an all-Australian event, with Rosewall and Fred Stolle up against John Newcombe and Tony Roche; the younger men triumphed). In Newcombe's opinion, Rosewall is 'probably the most accurate hitter of the ball that has ever been'. Between 1953 and 1972 Rosewall won four Australian, two French and two US singles championship titles. Asked about tennis in 1977 he said 'it's something I enjoy and find I still do well'. Rosewall was inducted into the international Tennis Hall of Fame in 1980, and its Australian counterpart in 1995. In 2008, the centre court of the Sydney Olympic tennis venue was named in his honour.

Having spent a year in Sydney, where he made carved furniture for the NSW Forestry Commission's contribution to the 1893 Chicago Exhibition, Parker left for London. He studied sculpture at the City and Guilds of London Technical Art School and worked as an assistant to a number of prominent practitioners. A regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy from 1903, Parker produced sculptures of classical and mythological figures in marble and bronze as well as memorial sculpture, portrait busts and reliefs. His Ariadne was acquired for the Tate in 1908; and he was awarded medals for the sculptures he exhibited in the Paris Salons of 1908 and 1910. In 1915, he started work on his most significant public commission - the large sculptures Prosperity and The Awakening of Australia for the entrance to Australia House in London, which were completed in 1918. In 1930, Parker returned permanently to Australia with his wife, Janet, whom he had married in London in 1911. He held solo exhibitions of his sculptures and watercolours in Sydney and Melbourne in the early thirties, and in 1938, his works The Pioneer and Eve repentant were exhibited in the sesquicentenary 'All Australian Art Exhibition' at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Though relatively few of Parker's works were acquired by Australian institutions during his lifetime, examples now reside in collections such as that of the University of Queensland, which also holds his personal papers. This miniature is believed to have been painted by Bessie Gibson (1868-1961), an Australian painter who, like Parker, grew up in Brisbane but lived and worked abroad for many years. Born in Ipswich, Gibson studied art at Brisbane Technical College and in 1905 left Australia for further study in Europe. She ended up staying for more than forty years, exhibiting regularly at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Franais and the Salon d'Automnes in Paris, where she lived, and at the Royal Academy.

His first novel, The Savage Crows, was published in 1975. He won Walkley awards for his journalism in 1976 and 1982. His short story collection The Bay of Contented Men (1989) won the Commonwealth Writers' Prize.

Nicholas Harding (b. 1956) came to Australia from England with his family as a boy. After studying for a BA he worked for twenty-two years as a freelance animator. His work was first exhibited in the Sulman Prize in 1980. Harding became known early on for huge pen and ink depictions of the railway tracks and shabby streets of inner Sydney, and the scrubby trees of the beaches of the north coast of New South Wales. He has since become well known for lush paintings on the same themes, as well as flowers, beach and river scenes and gardens. In 2001 he won the Dobell Drawing Prize as well as the Archibald (for his portrait of John Bell as King Lear). Robert Drewe opened one of his exhibitions at the Rex Irwin Gallery in Sydney.

There, he served in various administrative roles that equipped him for the posts of lieutenant-governor of Cape Colony and governor of Newfoundland, Jamaica, Honduras, and the Bay Islands in succession from 1855 to 1863. In September of that year he arrived to take up the governorship of Victoria, appearing to be the man with the experience for the job. However, he arrived in a post-gold rush colony in complex tumult over land laws, tariffs and the relative power of the upper and lower houses of parliament. Darling was soon censured for failing to check the dealings of his cabinet ministers and openly opposing further transportation. While the transportation issue died off, in 1865 twenty-two former cabinet ministers petitioned the queen about irregularities that Darling had allowed over the previous two years. He was recalled from office, and a successor was appointed, but he himself resigned from the colonial service in April 1867. Amidst popular outrage, based on the idea that Darling had become a 'martyr in the cause of progress', the legislative assembly tried (unsuccessfully) to make a grant of \u00a320000 to Lady Darling; but Darling met with no sympathy in England, having acted according to his own inclinations rather than exercising the restraint appropriate to his vice-regal position. Finally, after complicated ramifications, in May 1868 Darling was allowed to withdraw his resignation and he was granted a retrospective pension, but he died a broken man soon after.

Mentored by Archbishop Bede Polding, he was sent to Melbourne in 1847. Goold is said to have been the first person to make the journey from Sydney to Melbourne overland in his own carriage - a nineteen-day haul. Within a few months of his much- heralded arrival, he was vying for the title of Bishop of Melbourne with the Anglican, Charles Perry. Through the 1850s Goold sought equal recognition of Catholics at state functions; he boycotted the Queen's birthday levee in 1859. Meanwhile, he launched the Catholic Association to raise funds for local building, and international recruitment of clergy. He formed the Catholic Education Committee in 1861; soon it was at odds with the Victorian Board of Education, formed the following year, and Goold was warning the electorate not to vote for those advocating a 'scheme of godless compulsory education'. He tried to interest Rome in missions to the Chinese and Aborigines but here his hopes came to little. In 1873 in Rome it was announced the he would become Archbishop of Melbourne when it became a metropolitan see.   Goold's great tangible legacy is the William Wardell-designed St Patrick's Cathedral in East Melbourne. After some significant early setbacks, work on the church as it now stands began in 1858; on completion it was the largest church, anywhere in the world, built as a single entity in the nineteenth century.

In 1884 he was appointed Archbishop of Sydney; less than a year after his arrival he was made a cardinal-priest in Rome. Over the decade he presided over the construction of St Patrick's seminary at Manly, to which he contributed his accumulated manuscripts, books and museum pieces. He travelled indefatigably in Australia and New Zealand in the discharge of his duties, dedicating ten cathedrals and in twenty years laying eighty-eight foundation stones for churches and schools; he consecrated his greatest project, St Mary's in Sydney, in 1905. At the same time, he returned often to the northern hemisphere on business. He was a proponent of Federation, but failed to win a place on the New South Wales delegation to the Convention. Always suspicious of Protestants, in the 1880s and 1890s he spoke out on behalf of the Chinese and was dubbed 'The Chows' Patron' by the Bulletin; he was an advocate of female suffrage and the union movement, and his supposedly socialist leanings ultimately alarmed conservative Catholics, to say nothing of others. Having died at Manly, he was interred in the crypt of St Mary's. St Patrick's seminary ceased to operate as a going concern in 1995; the buildings have since housed a hospitality school and function centre, and were used as sets for Baz Luhrmann's film of The Great Gatsby.

In South Australia he nominally presided over a period of great expansion in Catholic facilities and personnel; there were scores of Catholic schools in his diocese.  However, for much of his time as bishop he was in Rome and Ireland, recruiting and attending to other business; and he was also in poor health. As a result, there was considerable confusion and disunity amongst South Australian Catholics during his bishopric. In 1871 he hastily excommunicated Mary MacKillop, founder of the teaching congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph.

He served a two- year apprenticeship on a whaling vessel before joining the Royal Navy, aged seventeen, in 1755. Phillip saw action in the Mediterranean, the West Indies, South America and Europe and served four years with the Portuguese navy before being given command of a Royal Navy vessel and rising to the rank of post-captain in 1781. Phillip's varied experience, along with his reliability and knowledge of matters such as farming and convict transportation, are counted among the reasons why, in October 1786, he was given the task of establishing a new colony on the east coast of Australia. The First Fleet sailed from Portsmouth in May 1787 and arrived in Botany Bay in January 1788. Phillip soon after relocated to a cove in Port Jackson, naming the settlement after Lord Sydney, the English politician who had appointed him the colony's first governor. During Phillip's governorship, the settlement experienced periods of extreme disquiet and uncertainty and critical shortages of food. Yet he had great hopes for the colony and is noted for his remarkable efforts at establishing peaceful relationships with Sydney's Indigenous people. Contemporaries described Phillip as a humane, exceedingly honest and diligent man with a warm sense of humour who was progressive in many of his ideas. He returned to England in 1792, but maintained a keen interest in New South Wales. He died in Bath in August 1814, shortly after having been promoted to Admiral. Painter Francis Wheatley (1747- 1801) was known for his portraits which typically presented his subjects in finely realised landscapes or interiors. His conversation pieces, such as his series of depictions of street vendors titled 'Cries of London', exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1792 and 1795, were also highly regarded. This portrait is an engraving of one of Wheatley's two paintings of Arthur Phillip. The better-known of the two, now in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London, shows Phillip in his naval uniform and standing on a beach; while the painting on which this engraving is based shows him holding a document inscribed 'New South Wales, 1787'. Both portraits are presumed to have been made to mark Phillip's appointment to the command of the new colony.

In 1800, on the rebound from a sad love affair, he volunteered for Baudin's expedition to the western and southern coasts of Australia on the G\u00e9ographe and Naturaliste.

A London-born blacksmith's son, Hodges trained at William Shipley's drawing school and at fourteen was apprenticed to landscape painter Richard Wilson. The Admiralty appointed Hodges to the Resolution in June 1772, when Joseph Banks - whose proposed entourage included four artists - withdrew from the expedition. Cook was to ensure that Hodges 'diligently employ himself in making Drawings or Paintings of such Places as you may touch at ... and also of other such Objects and things that may fall within the Compass of his Abilities'. Hodges's output during the voyage included many landscape views, topographical drawings, coastal profiles and portrait sketches. On his return, Hodges produced a number of dramatic, large-scale oil paintings of places such as Tahiti, New Zealand and Easter Island and supervised engravings made after his sketches for publication in Cook's official account of the voyage. He also produced the dark portrait of Cook that is now in the Maritime Museum, Greenwich. Between 1779 and 1784 Hodges was in India, working for the East India Company and the governor-general. In 1793 Hodges staged a solo show at Orme's Rooms in the Strand, centring on two subversive works depicting the effects of peace and the consequences of war. England was at war with revolutionary France at the time, and the exhibition was shut down after a visit from the Duke of York in 1795. After this, Hodges quit painting and moved with his family to Devon, where he opened a bank. This failed, along with other ventures and he died, possibly by his own hand, in March 1797. George Dance (1741-1825) studied architecture and draughtsmanship in Rome, returning to his native London on the completion of his grand tour in 1765.

Educated at a progressive girls' school in England, she enrolled at Sydney University in 1908, and during her three years there became involved in women's rights campaigns. In the years before her marriage to lawyer Kenneth Street in 1916, she attended international women's conferences; ran her own dairying business at Yulgilbar; spent time working at a women's hostel in New York; and founded the NSW Social Hygiene Association, which advised women on family planning.

Arriving in the city in 1937, she studied sculpture at East Sydney Technical College, modelling for artists to pay her rent, but soon turned to painting. In Melbourne, she co-led an artists' models' strike for better pay and conditions. Having married unionist Laurie Short, she worked as a cleaner and waitress at the Trocadero in Sydney. A trip to the USA with Short in 1956 enabled her to see the work of Pollock, de Kooning and Rothko, and on her return to Sydney she painted many vibrant abstracts. One of these was acquired by the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1960, the year of her first solo exhibition at Macquarie Galleries. In 1988 the same gallery purchased a self-portrait she had painted in 1943; in 1994, she received a substantial 'meritus award' from the Australia Council.

Born Maria Dolores Eliza Rosanna Gilbert in Ireland, Montez spent her early years in British military outposts in India and was in her teens when, in order to avoid being married off to a 'gouty old rascal' of her mother's choosing, she eloped with a British soldier. The marriage ended five years later and Montez was publicly named as an adulteress. She then fled to Spain where, having decided to earn a living on the stage, she received some form of tuition in dance and adopted the Spanish-sounding name. She made her London debut at Her Majesty's Theatre in June 1843, but soon fled again, performing in Berlin, Warsaw and Paris and attracting praise and scandal in equal measure. By 1846 she was in Munich, where she added King Ludwig I of Bavaria to an already impressive inventory of lovers. The relationship with Ludwig ended in 1848, when he was forced to abdicate amidst growing unrest at Lola's political influence. After five scandal- packed years in California, she came to Australia in 1855 and performed in Sydney and Melbourne. Metropolitan audiences were scandalised by Lola's routines, particularly her 'Spider Dance', in which she enacted having a spider caught in 'an extremely short gauze skirt'. Despite being denounced as immoral and 'utterly subversive', Montez went on to play to packed houses in Adelaide and was loved by the less discerning audiences in Ballarat, Bendigo and Castlemaine. Montez left Australia in 1856. When her stage career stalled the following year, she toured America and Britain delivering a series of lectures on beauty and morality. She died in New York from syphilis- related symptoms in January 1861. Purchased by the National Portrait Gallery in 2010, this portrait of Montez was initially thought to have been painted by the German artist, Friedrich Drck (1809-1884). However, research by one of Montez's biographers, Bruce Seymour, now indicates that it is one of two commissioned by King Ludwig I from Joseph Stieler (1781-1858), who painted thirty-six portraits for Ludwig's 'Gallery of Beauties' at Nymphenburg Palace, Munich, between 1827 and 1850. Stieler's second painting of Montez, completed in 1847, is displayed at Nymphenburg and is the most famous portrait of her. Montez sat for this portrait around the same time, but the end result was not to the King's satisfaction. Ludwig is believed to have given this painting to Montez who took it to England where it was sold in March 1849.

She had a son with him, but after a year she left him, returning to Melbourne to study under Pietro Cecchi. Making her way to Paris she became a pupil of Mathilde Marchesi, on whose advice she adopted the name Melba, derived from her native city, Melbourne. After making her d\u00e9but in Brussels in 1887, aged twenty-six, she made her Covent Garden debut in Lucia di Lammermoor the following year, but it was from June 1889, when she sang the title role in Gounod's Romeo et Juliette, that she dated her success in London. Henceforth she performed regularly at Covent Garden, where she maintained a private dressing room and gave her final performance in 1926. Over the same period, mobbed everywhere by fans and enjoying the attention of many lovers including Philippe, Duc d'Orl\u00e9ans, she made sensational tours of the USA and Europe. Partly resident in Australia from 1909 onwards, she sang the national anthem at the opening of Parliament House, Canberra in May 1927, during the period in which she made so many farewell appearances that across Australia the phrase 'doing a Melba' came to mean making repeated announcements that one is leaving, without actually departing. On her grave in Lilydale Cemetery, Melbourne, is the farewell uttered by Mimi in La Boh\u00e8me: 'Addio, senza rancor' ('Goodbye, no hard feelings'). Ernest Walter Histed was born in Brighton, UK, but made his reputation as a photographer in Chicago and later in Pittsburgh. He returned to England to set up a studio first in New Bond Street and then in Baker Street. In 1898 he made portraits of H Rider Haggard, Clara Butt and the Empress of Germany, the last by command of Queen Victoria at Windsor castle. He also photographed Royal Academicians, leading actors for The Candid Friend and Pope Pius X. The firm continued as Histed and Company when he moved to New York to operate a studio on Fifth Avenue. Having relocated to Palm Beach, Florida, he continued to work until 1934.

They married in Melbourne, a month after Mawson's return from Antarctica, in March 1914. Their first of their two daughters, Patricia, was born in 1915; she remained in Australia when Paquita went to England to assist Mawson in his wartime role with the Ministry of Munitions. Their second child, Jessica, was born in London in 1917. After the war, the family settled in Adelaide, where Paquita worked for the Mothers' and Babies' Health Association and the Australian Red Cross Society. Notable for her community work, Paquita was equally prominent in Adelaide's social and cultural life. She was appointed an officer of the Order of Oranje-Nassau in 1946 for her work with Dutch refugees during World War II; and was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1951.

Employed in a photographic lab in North Sydney, Scott has said he would often make excuses to slip away from work so as to go and take photos at 'demos', some of his best-known images documenting anti-Vietnam War protests, land rights rallies and Jack Mundey's Green Bans. He printed Carol Jerrems's work and became a friend of hers. The book Roger Scott: From the street was published in 2001, and a retrospective of his work, The 1970s: A decade of Protest was shown at the Museum of Sydney in 2008.

Born into an Irish Catholic family near Maitland, he earned his first money in the ring as a fourteen year old. By the time he was eighteen, Sydney boxing promoters had begun to import fighters to challenge him. He lost his first two fights in Sydney to American Fritz Holland. In January 1915 he faced another American, Jeff Smith, in a de facto contest for the world middleweight title. When Darcy complained of a low blow at the end of the fifth round, the referee believed that he did not want to continue and awarded the decision to Smith. In September 1916, Darcy was awarded the victory when Smith punched him in the groin. Between these contests Darcy won 22 consecutive bouts, in all winning 46 of his 50 professional fights. His apparent imperviousness to the fiercest of blows, his boyish looks and his working class background quickly made him a national hero - until his decision to earn money in America was read as a cowardly attempt to avoid enlisting. Denied a passport, he stowed away on a ship bound for New York on the eve of the 1916 conscription referendum. Darcy was stripped of his titles and the controversy followed him to the States, where promoters lost interest in him. To deflect further criticism, he volunteered for the army and became a US citizen in early April 1917, but a fortnight later was admitted to hospital suffering from an infected tooth. As the infection spread to his bloodstream, Darcy developed pneumonia and died. After an immense funeral procession in San Francisco, his twenty-one-year-old body was brought back to Australia. Around 250 000 people are said to have lined Sydney's streets as his casket was transported to Central Station for his journey back to Maitland for burial.

Lynch won the Sydney Surfabout contest, then the world's richest professional event, in 1975, and was runner-up in 1978; yet he is remembered as a soulful surfer rather than an aggressive competitor. He was rated the third-best surfer of all time by Surfing magazine in 2004, and seventeenth-best of all time by Surfer magazine in 2009.   Bob McTavish (b. 1944) shortboard pioneer, began surfing as a boy in Queensland, and worked for surfboard manufacturers from 1961. Having won the Queensland Open surf title in 1965, in 1966-67, inspired by the example of Californian kneeboard rider George Greenough, he began to develop a shorter surfboard that would open up new possibilities in the water, consigning 'noseriding' to history as the surfer was enabled to ride the wave, not the board. In 1969 he established his brand, McTavish, and in 1972 he launched the world's first production shortboard, the Bluebird. In the 1980s, McTavish turned to materials innovation; operating from a factory and retail base in Byron Bay, he sells his boards all over the world.   John Witzig (b. 1944), photographer, writer and designer, contributed his first piece to Surfing World in 1963. From 1967 to 1969 he was editor of Surf International. He took this picture of his friends in the hills behind Byron Bay as he was putting together his final issue of Surf International - the 'Country Soul' number. Like many of Witzig's era-defining shots, he says 'it got taken simply because I carried my camera around a lot'. In 1970 Witzig co-founded Tracks magazine, which is now acknowledged as 'maybe the hippest youth culture magazine being published anywhere in the world at the time'.

He married journalist Jeanne Lasker in 1959. Having had some success as an actor, Pratt took on the running of the family business, Visy Board, on his father's death in 1969. Under his direction, the packing materials business expanded from two Melbourne factories to fifty-five - in Australia, the USA, New Zealand and New Guinea - and ventured into paper recycling in the 1990s. Pratt was named Environmental Visionary of the Year and made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1998. He made substantial donations to political parties and retained former prime ministers and state premiers as consultants and advisers. He also donated substantial sums through the Pratt Foundation, established in 1978, to refugees, artists and environmental organisations. However, following earlier investigations, in December 2005 the ACCC commenced a civil penalty proceeding against Visy companies, Pratt, and others, for alleged involvement in a cartel in the packaging industry. In October 2007, six months after he became Chairman of the Carlton Football Club, Pratt was formally accused of price fixing; having eventually admitted his guilt, he was fined $36 million, some three-quarters of his fortune. He returned his Australian honours the following year. He died in April 2008, a day after further charges against him had been dropped.

A former soldier and member of the Bow Street patrol, and having risen to the rank of sergeant in London's Metropolitan Police Service, Ashton had been appointed by the commissioners for South Australia to the role of Sub-Inspector of Police, one of two such officers tasked with establishing policing in the new colony. In January 1839, Ashton was appointed first governor of Adelaide Gaol, despite the prisoner population at this time being accommodated in a temporary stockade from which escapes were commonplace. In 1840, Governor George Gawler instigated the construction of a secure, sandstone prison building, the first half of which was ready for use by April 1841. Ashton served as the governor of the gaol for the next fourteen years and was assisted in his work by Charlotte, who worked unpaid for several years before officially being given the job of prison matron. The gaol became known during the period of their tenure as 'Ashton's Hotel', perhaps because of William's well-documented generosity to inmates, such as providing them with Christmas dinner each year at his own expense. Ashton was also known as a judicious manager and was commended in the press for the 'efficient manner' in which he performed his duties. He was the target of misconduct allegations nevertheless and in early 1854 was accused of transgressions including drunkenness, misuse of government property, trafficking with prisoners, stealing rations and withholding prison earnings. It was in the midst of the legal proceedings relating to these charges that Ashton died, as a result of cardiac failure, in April 1854. Adelaide Gaol is still held by some to be haunted by his ghost. This watercolour is one of a number of depictions of Ashton by Henry Glover senior (c. 1810-1858), who emigrated to South Australia in 1848. In addition to his work as a publican, Glover produced paintings of Adelaide streets and scenes as well as portraits. The State Library of South Australia holds three of his portraits of William Ashton, including a group portrait titled The Governor and staff at the Adelaide Gaol 1850, which includes a portrait of Ashton's son, Albert, who was his father's 'constant companion'.

Travelling thousands of kilometres a week, he vitalised the mission before transferring to minister in the Sydney slum suburb of Glebe in 1942. Establishing the First Community Church in St Johns Road, for six years he worked with street children in the area. Following study overseas, he returned to Newcastle, where he founded the Australian Christian World newspaper. In Perth from 1953, he exponentially expanded the congregation at the city's Wesley Church, broadcast thrice weekly on radio, wrote for the West Australian and penned prayers and encouraging words, published posthumously as The Constant Flame (1997). In 1958 he created Good Samaritan Industries, which offered 'real pay for real work' by people with disabilities and has provided employment for thousands. Between 1959 and his death Sutton pioneered the first aged-care 'village' in Australia, Rowethorpe, comprising a range of living options, facilities, hospital and hostel care which served as a model for such developments nation-wide.

There he wrote his doctoral thesis, 'Toward a theory of consciousness', which became the influential book The Conscious Mind: In search of a fundamental theory (1996). Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and director of the Centre for Consciousness at ANU, and Professor of Philosophy and co-director of the Center for Mind, Brain, and Consciousness at New York University, Chalmers continues to probe the philosophy of mind and related areas of philosophy and cognitive science thinking, and lecture and write about all sorts of other issues to do with mind and language, metaphysics and epistemology, and the foundations of cognitive science. Attentive to the role of subjective experience in consciousness as much as neuroscience and the psychology of consciousness, in essence he seeks to determine a set of fundamental principles that connect physical processes to consciousness.

Having taught art continuously since 1975, he is now a lecturer at Monash University Faculty of Art and Design. Curator Christopher Chapman writes that 'after meeting David Chalmers for the first time Nick Mourtzakis was struck by his utter sensitivity. The subtlety of Chalmers's thinking, the lucidity and formality of his writing about consciousness suggested to Mourtzakis the necessity of making the portrait as non-material and non-physical as possible. Sketches the artist made from life were developed into the final portrait, which is a powerful likeness that evokes calmness and serenity. Within the complex open visual structure of geometric lines and spaces is the suggestion of the softness and substance of a marble bust. A thin vertical strip provides a vector of focus and stability and holds the freedom of the form together.

Banks grew up on his father's Lincolnshire estate and sharpened his interest in botany at Eton and Oxford. At the age of twenty-five, he suggested to the council of the Royal Society that they recommend him for inclusion on the voyage of the Endeavour, commanded by James Cook. On the three-year trip, he and Daniel Solander collected hundreds of specimens of plants and animals of the South Seas. For the rest of his life Banks was one of the sparkling stars of Enlightenment London. It was he who endorsed New South Wales as a site for a penal settlement; he was a patron of Matthew Flinders and others; and he corresponded zestfully with all the early governors of New South Wales. From 1788 to about 1810, though Banks held no official post (there was no 'master plan' for the settlement of the Colony, nor Department to administer it) he was a continuous advocate for the colony and his role as effective head of Australian affairs was widely acknowledged. Late in life, Banks's chief interests were the development of superior sheep varieties and the drainage of the Lincolnshire fens to create pasture. It is largely down to Banks's personal enthusiasm for merino sheep that specimens of the breed were established in Australia within a couple of decades of English settlement. John Macarthur was able to purchase seven rams and three ewes at the first public auction of merinos, supervised by Banks, near the Pagoda at Kew Gardens on 15 August 1804. Six of the beasts survived to land at Sydney on 7 July 1805. As a result, in years to come, England's irksome dependence on European wool would be eased. Thomas Phillips (1770-1845) painted Banks several times, and duplicated more than one of his own portraits of the great man. In this one, Banks sits with fen drainage plans to hand, wearing the uniform of the Lincolnshire Supplemental Militia, set off with the insignia of the Red Ribbon of the Order of the Bath which was awarded to him by his friend and fellow sheep enthusiast, King George III ('Farmer George') in 1795.

Her first book of poetry, Little Hoodlum, was published in 1975; subsequent volumes included Bison (1979), The Night Parrot (1984) and Driving too Fast (1989). In the early 1990s she wrote two novels for young adults. Akhenaten, the first of the narratives in verse for which Porter was particularly renowned, was published in 1992. The following year, she moved to Melbourne to live with the novelist Andrea Goldsmith, who was her partner for the rest of her life. Unusually, Porter managed to make a living from poetry. The Monkey's Mask (1994) staked out the demotic verse novel as a territory all Porter's own. It was named the Age Book of the Year for Poetry, won the National Book Council Award for Poetry and was the Braille Book of the Year; widely translated and published overseas, it was adapted for stage and radio and made into a film starring Kelly McGillis and Susie Porter. Subsequent verse novels, What a Piece of Work (1999) and Wild Surmise (2002) were both shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Award (in 2003 both Porter and Goldsmith were shortlisted - each for a book that she had dedicated to the other). Porter's last verse novel was El Dorado (2007). Having written two libretti, and lyrics for music by Paul Grabowsky, at the time of her death from complications arising from breast cancer she was collaborating with Tim Finn on a rock opera. The Bee Hut was published posthumously in 2009, as was her essay On Passion; finally, Goldsmith selected a volume of her Love Poems (2010). Rick Amor (b. 1948), unacquainted with Porter, first saw her on television. Intrigued that she didn't smile, he made a drawing of her as he sat and watched her talk; his interest in her increased when he read The Monkey's Mask. Soon after, at a book- signing, he asked if she would like to sit to him. His austere painting, showing Porter uncharacteristically quiet and still, is a tiny one that forces the viewer to come in close to the sitter's forbidding face. The women agreed that the portraitist had made Dorothy look older than she was.

During the voyage, for which he was paid 300 guineas, he made many pencil-and-wash landscapes, a series of coast profiles in pencil, some representations of Indigenous people and the first known European copies of Aboriginal cave paintings. Many of Westall's drawings were 'wetted and partly destroyed' when the Porpoise (aboard which Flinders and other expeditioners were returning to England) ran aground on Wreck Reef in 1803. Those drawings that were salvaged were then taken to London where, at the suggestion of Sir Joseph Banks, they were handed to Richard Westall to be restored. After spending some time in China and India, Westall returned to London in 1805 before travelling to Madeira and Jamaica.

With his brother, John, he emigrated to Van Diemen's Land in 1822. They took up a 1400 acre land grant before establishing a business with their younger brothers, James and Daniel, on Elizabeth Street, Hobart, in 1832. In September 1834, he married Margaret Whyte (1811-1866), the daughter of free settlers George and Jessie Whyte, who had emigrated from Scotland in 1832. The first of William and Margaret's seven children - three daughters and four sons - was born in 1835. By this time, Robertson had amassed sufficient capital to join a number of other investors in a scheme to expand pastoral activities to the Port Phillip district. These investors - known as the Port Phillip Association - helped finance John Batman's explorations of Port Phillip in 1835, during the course of which Batman made a so-called 'treaty' with the local Aboriginal people that became the basis for his land claim. Robertson travelled to Port Phillip in 1836 and 1837, selecting land near present-day Sunbury and, later, Colac. By the late 1840s, he was a major landholder, his properties stocked with 'the best bulls and cows that could be got in the colonies'. Robertson oversaw the operation of his pastoral empire from his home in Hobart until retiring from his business in 1852. He settled permanently at his Colac property, The Hill, in the 1860s, and was described on his death in 1874 as 'a founder of Victoria's fortunes'. William Robertson was a significant patron of local artists. In 1849, he commissioned paintings of himself, Margaret, and their eldest child, Jessie, from Thomas Bock (1790-1855), an ex-convict who in the 1830s became one of Hobart's most sought after portraitists. Bock was also one of the first practitioners of photography in Tasmania.

With two more solo shows soon after, Aspden found himself a frontrunner amongst Australia's formal colour abstractionists; two of his works were included in the seminal National Gallery of Victoria exhibition 'The field' in 1968. The use of colour that the self-taught artist refined in the 1960s became the hallmark of his painting over the ensuing decades. As early as 1970 he was described as 'Australia's leading colour-painter' and in 1971 he was awarded a gold medal at the Sao Paulo biennale. Increasingly, over some time, the hard edges of his interlocking colour blocks softened under the influence of landscape, nature and music. He exhibited in sixteen Wynne Prize exhibitions between 1977 and 1998, winning in 1995.

Blind from birth, and left-handed, he famously learned to play a right-handed guitar upside-down. He performed with Yothu Yindi from 1985 to 1992, when he formed his own outfit, the Saltwater Band. Gurrumul shot to prominence in 2008 with the release of his debut album Gurrumul, which was nominated for four ARIAs including Male Artist of the Year and Album of the Year; it won Best World Music Album and Best Independent Release. In March 2008 critic Bruce Elder foreshadowed Gurrumul's importance: 'Yunupingu has the potential to be to Indigenous music what painters such as Rover Thomas were to Indigenous art', he wrote. 'He is using a modern medium - in his case an angelic voice and the musical styles of gospel, soul and folk - to tell the traditional stories of his people and his culture. The result is authentically traditional aboriginal music that is instantly accessible to Western audiences.' The Age critic called Rrakala (2011) 'the definitive Australian folk record of our times'; in a cover article Rolling Stone called him 'Australia's most important voice'. Gurrumul sings about Gumatj stories in Yolngu but his song 'Gurrumul History' is in English, the better to spread his story. 'I like singing about the story properly, singing all the right names of land, and ancestors, because I have to give out the right story. It is like a celebration.' Guy Maestri (b.1974) saw Gurrumul perform in Sydney on New Year's Eve 2008. Stunned and desirous of a portrait, Maestri contacted a friend in the music industry who helped to track Gurrumul down in Darwin - but to the artist's dismay, the singer was set to fly to New York the following weekend. Maestri seized the offer of very short meeting early on the Saturday morning at Sydney airport. Not only did he complete many sketches on the spot, he writes that he 'got a sense of his presence and this determined the nature of the portrait: quiet and strong. I usually work in a very liberal, gestural way but this time I built up the image quietly and slowly with many glazes in an attempt to capture the beautiful quality of his skin. I worked on it for over a month, mostly while listening to his music. I made sure to read the lyrics and understand the meaning of each song. The whole process became quite an emotional experience.' Maestri's entries were rejected for the Archibald Prize  exhibition eight consecutive times before this portrait of Gurrumul took out the prize for 2009.

They had come to the colony on the recommendation of Frances's other uncles, Samuel and Saul Lyons, both of whom had become prominent businessmen in the 1820s. Saul Lyons had come to Sydney a free settler; Samuel Lyons had arrived as a convict after receiving a life sentence for theft in 1814. By 1827, despite escapes from custody and other misdemeanours, Samuel had been given a ticket of leave and established himself as a merchant, money lender and auctioneer. Newspaper references to Frances indicate that she enjoyed a genteel existence here for several years before returning to England with her mother in March 1841. Frances married in London in September 1850 and gave birth to a son in 1851. Frances lost both her husband and son during the following decade: the 1861 England census recording her as remarried and residing in St Pancras with Lydia in a household warranting several servants. Letters to her nephew, Edward, written in the 1890s, show that Frances was living in Earl's Court in her later years. Maurice Felton (1803-1842), artist and doctor, travelled to Australia as the surgeon on an immigrant ship called the Royal Admiral which arrived in Sydney in September 1839. Although listed in July of the following year as one of the colony's 'duly qualified medical practitioners', Felton appears to have been having more success as a painter. A few months after his arrival, The Australian was applauding Felton's portraiture, declaring 'for faithfulness of likeness and brilliancy of execution, they rival the productions of many of our best artists at home'. His work attracted the attention of arts patron and colonial businessman Alexander Brodie Spark, who in May 1840 commissioned Felton to paint a portrait of his wife. Spark also became one of the prominent citizens depicted by Felton over the next two years. In late 1841, Felton showed at his home in Hunter Street a number of portraits and 'some beautiful views of the interior of the country'. This exhibition was a lottery whereby subscribers, for one pound, purchased the chance of owning an example of 'Mr Felton's talents in the delightful art of painting'. The exhibition appears also to have been a means by which Felton attempted to provide for the family he had relocated to Australia two years earlier. He died, aged thirty-nine, in March 1842.

She joined the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of California in Berkeley in 1978. At a conference in 1980, she announced her discovery of a repeated DNA sequence at the ends of chromosomes of a single-celled organism. Since then she has unravelled the mystery of the telomere, a protective structure or 'cap' at the end of the chromosome. As organisms age, the telomeres fray and degrade, like the aglets on shoelaces. In 1984 she and Carol Greider, who had been her doctoral student, confirmed the existence of an enzyme, telomerase, which replenishes the telomere.  Blackburn moved to the University of California San Francisco in 1990.  In 2001 she was appointed to the President's Council on Bioethics, but after criticising the stance of the Bush administration on embryonic stem cell science she was controversially dropped.

Three years after the program's commencement, the rate of incidence of the abnormality was nearly halved. Stanley also discovered that cerebral palsy is not due so much to birth trauma as to events earlier in pregnancy, such as infections or placental problems which disrupt normal brain development. Her initiative Ngunytju Tjitji Pirni, a service of enhanced care for Aboriginal women and children in the Eastern Goldfields of WA, was the first of its kind in Australia. She was the founding Director of the Telethon Institute for Child Health Research in 1990, and as a result of her lobbying, the multi-disciplinary Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth (ARACY) was launched in 2002.

Of Polish, Irish and Scottish heritage, she was the eldest child of socially progressive parents who fostered her interest in issues of education and welfare. After attending Presbyterian Ladies College, Melbourne, she opened a school with her sisters and during the same period became active in the fight for women's suffrage. She was appointed general secretary of the United Council for Women's Suffrage in 1900 and established the paper The Woman's Sphere. An able, quick-witted public speaker, in America in 1902 she gave evidence to a Congressional committee on women's suffrage and attended the International Council of Women Conference before returning home to run for a Senate seat in the 1903 Federal election. She was unsuccessful despite attracting over 50 000 votes. Undeterred, she set about to educate women on the matter of the vote, Victorian women still being unable to vote in state elections despite being granted the right to do so in Federal polls in 1902. Goldstein stood for parliament again, without success, in 1910, 1913, 1914 and 1917, campaigning on equal pay, equal property rights, industrial reform and many other issues. She launched her second paper, the weekly Woman Voter in 1909; and in 1911 the militant Women's Social and Political Union invited her to London, where she was touted as 'one of the foremost leaders of the Australian women's movement ... now helping her sisters in England to win their freedom'. A committed pacifist, during World War I she served as chairman of the Peace Alliance and formed the Women's Peace Army with the English suffragette, Adela Pankhurst. After the war she took an increasing interest in international matters, advocating disarmament and the pursuit of better living standards. She died from cancer in 1949.

A free settler named George Augustus Robinson (1788-1866) was appointed to the position of 'Conciliator of Aborigines' to bring this policy into effect. Between 1830 and 1834, he conducted a series of expeditions - known as the 'Friendly Mission' - during the course of which, aided by guides and interpreters such as Trukanini (c. 1812-1876), he persuaded Aboriginal people into exile. Trukanini and others associated with Robinson consequently became popular subjects for portraits, partly for reasons of celebrity but also because of the white community's belief in the idea that Tasmania's Aboriginal people were disappearing. Charles Alfred Woolley (1834-1922) was one of a number of photographers who created portraits of Trukanini in the 1860s, by which time it was held, erroneously, that she was among the 'last' of her people. Woolley ran a studio on Macquarie Street in Hobart from 1859 to 1870, and is perhaps best known for his series of portraits - of Trukanini, William Lanne, Cooneana, Wapperty and Bessy Clark. Woolley photographed each sitter at three different angles: one face on; one with face averted from the camera; and one in profile, as in this example. Taken in Hobart in August 1866, they were exhibited at the Intercolonial Exhibition in Melbourne later the same year. The photographs subsequently ended up in anthropological collections overseas, engravings of them appeared in various publications, and they were exhibited by Woolley again in the 1870s.  Some years later, Woolley's negatives were acquired by John Watt Beattie (1859-1930), a photographer who ran a private museum in Hobart displaying his collection of convict relics and other artefacts relating to Tasmania's history, environment and people. He was also a collector of photographic prints and negatives which he reprinted for sale as postcards and souvenirs.

In September 1834, he married Margaret Whyte (1811-1866), the daughter of fellow Scottish settlers. In 1835, Robertson joined a number of other investors in a scheme to expand pastoral activities into the Port Phillip district. Over the course of the next decade, he became a major landholder in the new colony, with substantial holdings in the area around Colac. He oversaw the operation of his pastoral empire from his Hobart home until 1852 and settled permanently at his Victorian property, Corangamarah, later called The Hill, in the early 1860s.  The group of donated Robertson family photographs includes hand-coloured daguerreotypes of William and Margaret, and of their second eldest son, William junior (1839-1892).

Ambrotypes, however, were not available in Australia prior to 1854, six years after the birth of  William and Margaret's youngest child.

Czechoslovakian-born Lowy spent World War II in Nazi-occupied Budapest, leaving Europe in 1946 for Israel. In Australia from 1952, he joined family members in a smallgoods business and with compatriot John Saunders started the Westfield Development Corporation, which opened its first shopping centre at Blacktown in 1959. By the 1970s, there were Westfield centres in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, the company expanding into the USA, New Zealand and the UK in the succeeding decades. A fixture on Business Review Weekly's Rich List every year since 1983, Lowy was a director of the Reserve Bank from 1995 to 2005 and during this period was named Australia's leading philanthropist, with gifts in 2002 of $10 million. A longstanding advocate of soccer in Australia, Lowy was elected chairman of Football Federation Australia in 2003; and established the Lowy Institute for Foreign Policy the same year. In 2008 he made an undisclosed donation to the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute and in 2010 gave $10 million towards the Lowy Cancer Research Centre at the University of New South Wales. Having first learnt in the early 1990s of his father's death at Auschwitz in 1944, Lowy funded the restoration of a railway carriage that had been used to transport Jewish people to concentration camps; the carriage was then relocated to Auschwitz as a memorial to his father and the thousands of others who died there. Made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2000, in the US Lowy has been honoured with the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship (2005), and the Henni Friedlander Award for the Common Good (2007).

While working for the US National Science Foundation, the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute in the Netherlands, and the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, she developed a specialisation in gravitational microlensing to search for extrasolar planets, as well as interests in dark matter and galactic structure.  In 2002 she was appointed director of the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Australian National University. In 2006 she was one of an international team of 73 astronomers who discovered the first known earth-sized planet orbiting a normal star other than the Sun in the inner Milky Way. Sackett was appointed the Chief Scientist for Australia in late 2008, but remained an adjunct professor at ANU and continued to supervise research students. She resigned as Chief Scientist in 2011, announcing that she intended to contribute to science in other ways (she describes herself as physicist by training, an astronomer by profession and an educator by inclination.) A dual citizen, Sackett is an Elected International Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. Andrew Mezei was born to Hungarian refugee parents in Melbourne and grew up in their leather-goods workshop, observing their adherence to a tradition of fine European craftsmanship. He obtained a bachelor of fine art from RMIT in 1983, and later studied old master techniques under Richard Clements. His painting is informed by science and emotionally charged by a view of the world as teetering on the edge of ecological destruction, while human knowledge increases exponentially. Following Dutch Masters' techniques from the baroque period, he incorporates fine and rare pigments, resins and oils into his painting, and grinds most of his own colours. Entering this portrait in the Archibald Prize for 2011, Mezei stated that he aspired to paint Sackett after hearing her speak on the radio. He wrote 'She responded to scepticism about climate change with eloquent reasoning in spite of the historical depiction of women as emotional beings, and reason as being a purely male domain . . . Her warm humanist approach inspired me to portray her as an allegory of reason . . . I wanted to show her femininity as perfectly compatible with her impeccable focus on facts. That warmth is portrayed through the red drapery on her lap: the more intense I could make it, the better.' The setting is imagined, though informed by various images of Mount Stromlo Observatory. The artist writes 'I wanted to construct an interior that would reflect her psychological space . . . I also wanted to portray professor Sackett's calm and steady personality. I placed three circles in the composition; the globe, the mirror, and the small bolt above her head. I set them in orbit, rotating around the focal point of the subject. This also reflects the broader human condition, as we are all contained within a bubble in space, as suggested by my self-portrait in the convex mirror.'

Since then he has created a repertoire of some seventy works, including productions for Opera Australia, the Australian Ballet, and the Metropolitan Opera, New York. His most popular piece is perhaps Poppy (1978), a full-length ballet based on the life of Jean Cocteau, in which he danced the title role four years after announcing his retirement.

Scott grew up near Singleton in New South Wales and with her sisters was educated at home by her mother, Sarah Anne. Scott became her mother's primary carer in 1879; and the following year, on the death of her older sister, adopted her two-year-old nephew, Harry. In Sydney from 1880, Scott became increasingly involved in intellectual and political activities, helping to establish the Women's Literary Society in 1889; becoming one of the founding members of the Womanhood Suffrage League (1891) and the New South Wales National Council of Women (1896); and co-founding The Women's Club in 1901. A key player in the Australian campaign for universal suffrage, Scott was engaged in a variety of other social issues, lobbying for women's citizenship, employment and higher education rights; and for reforms aimed at restraining the sexual exploitation of women and girls. Her report on conditions in Darlinghurst Gaol led to the opening of a separate women's prison in 1908. She campaigned for legislation by which the age of consent was raised to sixteen (in 1910) and laws regarding child maintenance and the access of widows to their husbands' estates were enacted. Scott was also known for the literary salons conducted at her Woollahra home, where guests could expect to encounter Miles Franklin, Banjo Paterson, Vida Goldstein and others. Believing that 'life is too short to be wasted in the service of one man', Scott never married. She died in Sydney in 1925.  May Moore (1881-1931) studied at Auckland's Elam School of Fine Arts before moving to Wellington around 1908. There, in partnership with her younger sister, Mina (1882-1957), she became known for a distinctive brand of portraiture employing shadowy, dramatic lighting. She moved to Sydney in 1910 and early in 1911 Mina relocated to Australia to assist in the business. The sisters opened a studio on Melbourne's Collins Street in 1913. Managed by Mina it became the portrait studio of choice for numerous visiting performers.

Though he qualified for admission to the University of Sydney, he did not study there, serving an apprenticeship as a typographer in Sydney before returning to Queensland to work as editor of the Gympie Miner and then as editor and part-owner of the Cairns Argus. Selling his stake in the newspaper in 1892, he travelled to North America and Europe, sending articles back to Australia for publication in a number of periodicals. He joined the Bulletin as sub-editor in 1894; in 1896, he established the paper's famous 'Red Page' of literature-related news, reviews and anecdotes. As literary editor and head of the Bulletin's publishing arm, 'A.G.S.' was the country's most widely-read literary critic and significantly influenced the careers and work of a generation of writers, among them Henry Lawson, Joseph Furphy, Steele Rudd, Miles Franklin and Mary Gilmore. He rented a room in Rowe Street, Sydney with books, a bunk and combined basin and desk in it, and often stayed in the city after his famous Saturday night literary gatherings instead of returning to his home up the North Shore line. Stephens left the Bulletin in 1906 and focused on his own creative writing - now judged vastly inferior to his criticism - and on the production of his literary journal, the Bookfellow, which foundered, was resurrected, failed again and eventually ruined the father-of-seven financially. Between the demise of Bookfellow in 1925 and his own death twelve years later, Stephens continued to produce articles, short stories and verse and edited books on the poets Henry Kendall and Christopher Brennan.

Five years later, the young woman from Murrurundi became a household name in Australia as the first female reporter on the ABC current affairs program This Day Tonight (1968 to 1972). After four years on TDT she debuted as a presenter and reporter on 4 Corners, remaining on the program to 1981. Meanwhile, from 1977 onward she broadcast regularly on ABC radio. As presenter of The Search for Meaning from 1987 to 1994, she became renowned for the gentle tact with which she drew out the stories of her interlocutors; she has since emerged as a low-key spokesperson on Christian issues. Since 1996 she has presented Australian Story. A foundation member of the Australia Council for the Arts, she has been a Reconciliation Ambassador for the Aboriginal Council for Reconciliation since 1998. That year, her book An Authentic Life - Finding Meaning and Spirituality in Everyday Life was an Australian best-seller. Her next book, Through a Glass Darkly (2009) is a heartrending chronicle of her experience of the death of her father. For more than twenty years Jones has been a designated Living National Treasure. Now a mentor for women in media, she won the Walkley Award for Outstanding Contribution to Journalism in 2013, fifty years into her career. David Campbell (1952-1984) formed a determination to become an artist while a student at Erina High on the New South Wales Central coast. He studied from 1973 to 1977 at the Alexander Mackie College of Advanced Education. Over the following years, he lived and painted in the loft of a building on the corner of Pitt and Market streets in Sydney (now a Macdonalds franchise), supporting himself as a cleaner, a tennis coach, a professional surfer, an assistant in an aged-care facility and a waiter at Tattersalls. He only ever painted three portraits; with his first, of Adrian Rawlins, he became the youngest artist ever to have a work hung in the Archibald. For the painting of Jones, he spent many hours in the ABC studios, studying and sketching her expressions, personality and mannerisms as she taped her programs. The resulting portrait incorporates elements of his customary abstract practice. In August 1979, when twenty-two windows of the Myer store fronting two Sydney streets were filled with his watercolour paintings, the unconventional portrait of Jones was amongst them. While living and painting in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, David Campbell was killed as he rode his motorbike back to Sydney to work.

Having helped found the Women's Liberation Movement in Australia and following a short-lived marriage, Summers moved to Sydney and in 1973 was part of a cooperative that established Australia's first refuge for victims of domestic violence, the Elsie Women's Refuge in Glebe. While studying for a doctorate at the University of Sydney, Summers commenced work on what became her first book, Damned Whores and God's Police, which appeared in 1975. Following its publication, she began working for the National Times in Sydney and in 1976 won a Walkley Award for a feature on the NSW prison system. Summers ran the Commonwealth Government's Office for the Status of Women from 1983 to 1986; and worked as an adviser to Paul Keating during his term as prime minister. In New York from 1986 to 1992, Summers was editor-in-chief of Ms magazine; and later edited the Good Weekend. Her autobiography, Ducks on the pond, was published in 1999; and her book The lost mother: a story of art and love (2010) was shortlisted for the Victorian Premier's Literary Awards. In 2013 she published The Misogyny Factor, an analysis of the status of women in contemporary Australia. This photograph by Carol Jerrems (1949-1980) is one of several she took of Summers in January 1974, at which time Summers was working intensely on her first book.

Though the scheme was never carried out, Townshend took note of the naval officer who had devised it: Captain Arthur Phillip. In 1783, Townshend became Baron Sydney and entered the House of Lords. As home secretary, he took charge when, in mid-1786, William Pitt's government decided to send the First Fleet to Botany Bay. He appointed Phillip to the command of the fleet and named him governor-designate of New South Wales. The new settlement - relocated to Port Jackson when the initial site, Botany Bay, proved unsuitable - was named Sydney Cove by Phillip in January 1788. Historians debate Sydney's skill as a politician, but it is generally agreed that he made a good choice in Phillip, who steered the colony steadily through the hardships of its first four years.

Elected to the first Australian parliament in 1901 as the member for Ballarat, he took over from Barton as prime minister when the latter retired to take up the position of High Court judge.

Sir Henry Parkes GCMG (1815-1896) was five times premier of New South Wales between 1872 and 1891, and a consistent advocate for union of the colonies (Federation). An ivory-turner by trade, Parkes was a man of meagre education but immense energy, and his stints as premier were only one aspect of a multifarious life encompassing three marriages; many children; five volumes of verse; several prose works; numerous pamphlets; hundreds of letters; and a series of reversals of fortune, including several bankruptcies. By 1881, twenty- five years after winning the seat of Sydney City on the first New South Wales Legislative Assembly, he was recognised abroad as 'the most commanding figure in Australian politics'. In all, he was an MLA for twelve different seats between 1856 and 1895. Near the end of his political career, in October 1889, he made the speech at Tenterfield, New South Wales, that earned him the title of Father of Federation, calling for a federal convention to work out 'a great National government for all Australia'. The Federal Convention came to pass in Melbourne in February 1890. There, Parkes responded to a toast to 'A United Australia' by asserting that 'the crimson thread of kinship runs through us all ... We know the value of ... British origin. We know that we represent a race ... for the purpose of settling new colonies, which never had its equal on the face of the earth.' In his seventies, he was twice remarried (to much younger women); he fathered a child; and he completed his book Fifty Years in the Making of Australian History. Alfred Deakin expressed the complexity of Parkes's identity when he wrote that 'there was in him the man he dressed himself to appear'. Nelson Illingworth trained in sculpture in England and worked as a modeller at the Royal Doulton potteries for nine years before moving to Australia. In the 1890s he set up the Denbrae Fine Art Pottery at Forest Lodge to make a range of flowerpots, fernpots and statuettes. A member of the Dawn and Dusk Club, which also included Henry Lawson and Victor Daley, he made 'jorums, jugs, goblets and flagons of clay, china and porcelain for the use and delight' of the members of the Club.

With Liverpool, Kewell took part in the Champions League win against AC Milan in 2005, despite being subbed-off early in the final; and he was a member of the Reds team that defeated West Ham United to take out the 2006 FA Cup. First selected for Australia, aged seventeen, in 1996, Kewell was part of the Socceroos squad that in November 2005 defeated Uruguay in a penalty shoot-out for a place in the 2006 World Cup Finals. It was the first time since 1974 that Australia had qualified. Later, Kewell's man-of-the-match performance in a group stage game against Croatia played a crucial role in the Socceroos' progression, for the first time, to the knock-out stage of the competition. In all, Kewell played 56 games for the Socceroos. At the conclusion of five injury-plagued seasons with Liverpool, Kewell signed with the Turkish club, Galatasaray, remaining there until an opportunity to play for the A-League's Melbourne Victory instigated his return to Australia in 2011. Kewell was voted Australia's greatest ever footballer in a 2012 poll of fans, players and experts and was named in Australia's all-time best soccer side. He retired from professional soccer in March 2014. Julian Kingma (b. 1968) commenced  his  photographic career in 1988 as a cadet for the Age in Melbourne, and went on to work there for ten years as a features photographer.

Since he began working freelance in 2003, his photographs have featured regularly in magazines such as The Good Weekend, Black + White, Harpers Bazaar and Rolling Stone.

Supposedly expelled from every school he attended, he went to New Guinea in his late teens and dabbled at various ventures including gold prospecting, tobacco growing and a boat charter business. He made his feature film debut as Fletcher Christian in Charles Chauvel's In the Wake of the Bounty (1933). He then made his way to London where he joined a touring theatre company and scored some film roles. His suave, moustachioed look and athletic frame eventually attracted attention across the Atlantic and in late 1934 he moved to California. Minor roles in two films followed before he shot to fame in the 1935 swashbuckler Captain Blood. Subsequent roles in films such as The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), The Dawn Patrol (1938), The Sea Hawk (1940) and Gentleman Jim (1942) cemented his appeal. Quoted as saying that 'the public has always expected me to be a playboy, and a decent chap never lets his public down', Flynn's off-screen life was noted for excesses of drinking, fighting and womanising. His lifestyle resulted in a catalogue of conditions that eroded the good looks that had made his career and ultimately led to his death at the age of fifty. His autobiography, My wicked, wicked ways - quipped to be his best work of fiction - was published posthumously in 1959.   Cincinnati-born George Hurrell (1904-1992) studied painting at Chicago's Art Institute and Academy of Fine Arts in the early 1920s before moving to California. Thereafter his sideline in portrait photography developed into a full-time career, eventually seeing him appointed head of photography at MGM Studios. A leading exponent of Hollywood glamour photography, with MGM and then Warner Brothers, Hurrell photographed many icons of 1930s and 1940s cinema, including Marlene Dietrich, Clark Gable, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, Greta Garbo, Jean Harlow and Katherine Hepburn. Consequently his work has featured in major exhibitions, including Glamour of the Gods, shown at the National Portrait Gallery in London in 2011.

He briefly attended business college while continuing to submit cartoons for various publications, raising the occasional objection from employers for the political tendencies of some of his works. While working for the Canterbury Times, he began sending examples of his work to a score of Australian editors each week - a strategy which eventually landed him a job with the Bulletin, which brought him to Australia in 1911. He drew many caricatures, mainly of political figures, for the Bulletin and also contributed to the Lone Hand. A review of his drawings in 1915 stated: 'Mr Low is not in the least cruel ... one might even say that at times his work approaches portraiture.' In late 1916 he was exempted from war service on the basis that his work was of national importance.

Two years later they moved to their current premises, Lucio's in Paddington, in which they have established one of Australia's most-awarded Italian restaurants, as renowned for its art as for its food (in a European tradition, they have offered artists meals in exchange for their productions, and major artworks line the restaurant's walls).

He won the Archibald Prize in 1993 for his portrait of an old friend, Sydney publisher Tom Thompson. Shead has said of Galletto, 'he just makes you feel so welcome ... he treats everyone like family and makes them feel special.' A 'soffritto' is a combination of ingredients providing the flavoursome base upon which an Italian dish is built. Shead explains that in this 'combination' portrait, he has set the restaurateur against a panorama of the village of Ameglia, in the area in which he grew up (depictions of Dante and Beatrice in the background refer to the fact that Dante wrote part of his Divine Comedy in Ameglia). In his arms Galletto is holding an image of the Last Supper. The Christ figure is also a reference to DH Lawrence (subject of a major series of Shead's paintings) who spent time in Lerici, nearby, in 1914. Shead and his partner, Adrienne Levenson, collaborated on a mosaic rendering of one of Shead's pictures of DH Lawrence and Frieda in 2009. As the deadline for Archibald entries approached, Shead had still not resolved problems he had been having with his sitter's face. Levenson helped; and 'suddenly there he was' Shead says.

Born in Sunbury, Middlesex, Fisk began his career in the British Post Office and later studied at the Marconi Wireless Telegraphic Company training school in Liverpool. After qualifying as a radio engineer and operator, he worked for Marconi in North America before first visiting Australia in 1910. At that time, Australia was still dependent on underwater cables for contact with the rest of the world, prompting Fisk to return in 1911 to further promote and demonstrate the use of Marconi equipment. In 1913, Marconi and its German rival, Telefunken, combined to form Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd, known as AWA, which gained exclusive rights throughout Australasia to the patents of the two companies' equipment. A founding director, Fisk was AWA's general and technical manager before becoming its managing director in 1917. Believing wireless to be 'the greatest gift of science to Australia', in 1918 he instigated the first wireless communication  between  Australia and Britain when a message from Prime Minister Billy Hughes in Wales was sent via a receiver installed at Fisk's house in Sydney. In 1922, the Australian government commissioned AWA to implement a direct radio link with Britain. This began operation in April 1927, and the radio service between Australia and Canada commenced the following year. In 1930, AWA established an Empire radiotelephone service. Fisk was knighted in 1937.

Her abstract landscapes are evoked in the background to the finished self-portrait, which is more sombre and dragging in every respect than this sketchy, light-filled, rosy study.

Both she and Franklin viewed Van Diemen's Land not merely as a prison but a new society in which education, science and the arts should be fostered. Jane accordingly approached her role with the belief that she could contribute to the development of the colony and, in so doing, support and aid her husband in his work. Jane's energy and enthusiasms, however, were seen by conservative colonists as dangerous eccentricities and, within the bitter political environment of Franklin's term of office, were ultimately held to constitute an unacceptable interference in government affairs.

After directing and writing several shorts and documentaries, she released a full-length 16mm film, The Singer and the Dancer, which she also co-produced and which won best narrative film at the 1976 Sydney Film Festival. The same year, she made Smokes and Lollies, the first instalment of what became a series of documentaries chronicling the lives of a group of three Australian women. In 1979, Armstrong directed her first feature, the critically- acclaimed adaptation of Miles Franklin's My Brilliant Career. Produced by Margaret Fink and starring Judy Davis, the film won seven Australian Film Institute (AFI) awards, including Best Picture, and was nominated for an Academy Award. Having directed the musical Starstruck (1982) and a number of rock videos, Armstrong made her first American film, Mrs Soffel (1984) featuring Mel Gibson and Diane Keaton. After making further films in Australia, including the AFI award-winning High Tide (1987) and The Last Days of Chez Nous (1992), she returned to the USA to make Little Women (1995). Armstrong's subsequent films include Oscar and Lucinda (1997) and Charlotte Gray (2001), both featuring Cate Blanchett; and Death Defying Acts (2007). Thrice-winner (in 1979, 1987 and 1992) of the AFI award for Best Director, Armstrong was awarded the Grand Jury Prize at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival for Unfolding Florence, a film about wallpaper designer, Florence Broadhurst. In 2010, Armstrong won the Australian Director's Guild Award for Love, Lust and Lies, the fifth film in the series that started with Smokes and Lollies in 1976. Stuart Campbell (1951-2009) studied at NIDA and during the 1970s and 1980s had some success as an actor in theatre, television and film. His friends from this sphere became his subjects when, from the early 1980s, he became increasingly involved in his work as a portrait photographer. Gillian Armstrong recalls, 'Stuart had a great ability to relax people, so they could forget about the camera', resluting in portraits of great sensitivity.

Here, Eason constructed whaling ships and vessels 'well adapted for the Coasting, Port Phillip or Sydney trade', among them the Isabella (1840), Scotia (1841), Allison (1844) and Mary Ann (1849). Eason also appears to have spent some time at Macquarie Harbour in 1846 and 1847, during the period in which the former penal settlement on the remote west coast of the island was reopened as a shipyard. Tasmanian  newspapers  throughout the 1840s carry advertisements for several vessels of Eason's design and construction, each considered to have been 'constructed of the best materials, expressly for the colonial trade'. Eason died at his home on Watchorn Street, Hobart on 2 May 1858, his death notice describing him as 'for many years a shipbuilder of this city'.  William Buelow Gould (1803-1853) is believed to have worked as a draftsman for the London printmaker, Rudolph Ackermann, and as a porcelain painter for Spode's works in Staffordshire before being transported to Van Diemen's Land for theft in 1827. Although skilled convicts were useful to the authorities, Gould soon began downgrading his worth through recidivism and a month after landing in Hobart had recorded the first of numerous misdemeanours. In June 1829, having attempted to pass a fake banknote, he was sentenced to three years at Macquarie Harbour, but was among those marooned when some of the convicts on the ship transporting him there (the Cyprus) mutinied and escaped on the stolen vessel. Gould was rewarded for not absconding with assignment to Colonial Surgeon, James Scott, for whom Gould produced one of the 'most splendid collections of inimitable drawings not only of the plants but most of the birds of this island'. Despite this, Gould continued to offend and was banished to Macquarie Harbour again in 1832. Assigned to medical officer, William de Little, Gould collected and drew botanical and natural history specimens, creating the watercolours now contained in his exquisite 'Sketchbook of fishes'. Gould completed his sentence at Port Arthur and received his certificate of freedom in 1835. Back in Hobart from early 1836, Gould set about earning a living for himself and his growing family through his painting. Though prolific, Gould's practice was marred by poverty, alcoholism and further run-ins with the law. He died in Hobart in 1853, having produced landscapes and portraits along with the natural history  illustrations and still life paintings for which he is now best known.

Mundey grew up on a Queensland farm before moving to Sydney to try out for the Parramatta Rugby League side in 1948. Employed in a factory, he joined the Federated Ironworkers' Union and then the Communist Party, of which he was later president for some years. In the early 1960s he led the rank and file in action to improve safety and sanitary conditions for workers. As Secretary of the NSW Branch of the Builders' Labourers' Federation from 1968 to 1975, he encouraged members to become informed on and involved in broad social movements and international politics. In the four years following the first 'green ban' at Kelly's Bush, Hunters Hill, in the early 1970s, he estimates there were more than forty such bans imposed by unions, scuttling many millions of dollars' worth of development on sites with historical or ecological heritage value. Patron of the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales and a Living National Treasure, Mundey has two honorary doctorates. Jack Mundey Place in The Rocks, Sydney, is named in his honour. Terry Milligan, a former photographer now known as Venerable Ekaggata, was born in San Francisco and lived in various locations in the US and Australia before discovering the small town of Braidwood, near Canberra. He ran the general store and gallery at nearby Mongarlowe from 1994 to 1999, photographing the district's personalities. Photography critic Robert McFarlane found it 'impossible not to be moved by [the photographs'] priceless nature'. Milligan abandoned photography when he became a Buddhist monk in Western Australia in 2002. He now divides his time between various monasteries in Australia and Thailand, occasionally unearthing gems from his photographic archive.

Scottish- born Robertson had emigrated to Van Diemen's Land in 1822 and in the decade leading up to his marriage to Margaret, the daughter of free settlers, had developed substantial landowning and business interests in the colony. Like many other spectacularly successful settlers, Robertson became something of a patron of local artists. In 1849, he commissioned portraits from Thomas Bock of himself, his wife, and his brother, James, as well as a portrait of Jessie. This drawing is a preparatory study for the painting of Jessie, now in the collection of the Art Gallery of South Australia. In early December 1849 shortly after sitting for this portrait, Jessie died, aged fourteen, at the Robertson family home in Hobart, a memorial notice in the Colonial Times referring to her having suffered 'a long and severe affliction.'  Thomas Bock (1790-1855), arrived in Hobart in January 1824, transported for fourteen years for his part in attempting to cause the miscarriage of a child conceived as a result of his seducing a young woman. At the time of his conviction, Bock was thirty-two, married and father to five children. As stated in his convict record, he had 'served an apprenticeship to the Engraving Business' and worked in Birmingham as a 'portrait painter and engraver'. The colonial authorities therefore found immediate use for Bock, some of his earliest Tasmanian works being bank notes he engraved for the Bank of Van Diemen's Land and drawings of executed criminals, made at the request of the Colonial Surgeon. After attaining a free pardon in 1833 he became Hobart's most sought- after portraitist. Among his most significant works are his series of watercolours depicting Trukanini, Manalargenna and other Indigenous leaders, painted in the 1830s; and his 1842 portrait of Mathinna, an Aboriginal girl taken from her family in 1839 at the direction of Sir John and Lady Jane Franklin and sent to live at Government House in Hobart. Bock's diverse output incorporated printmaking, drawing, watercolour and pastel as well as oil painting and photography. On his death in Hobart in March 1855 he was described as 'an artist of a very high order' whose works 'adorned the homes of a number of our old colonists and citizens'.

After the war, she and her husband reunited and came to Australia.  Finding that she could not make a living through painting, she took up teaching because her husband would not let her work in a factory.  She hardly spoke English and was disoriented by the strange light and seasons, but found inspiration for a more abstract style of painting in the landscape of the Northern Territory, to which she repeatedly returned.  Gradually, she made friends with artists such as Jeffrey Smart, Stanislaus Rapotec and Desiderius Orban.  In 1961 she became the first woman in twenty years to win the Archibald Prize, with a portrait of Rapotec.  She won again with a portrait of her friend and fellow artist, Margo Lewers, in 1968. The Art Gallery of New South Wales describes these portraits as 'strong paintings which were considered to be the first serious attempts among Archibald entries to bring portraiture into the modern idiom.'

Around 1826, he established Swan's Stores, on Elizabeth Street; by the end of the decade it was one of Hobart's best shops, trading in clothing, millinery, fabrics ('which for quality and fashion have never been equalled in the colony') and also 'household furniture and upholstery of the best description'. Swan and his wife Mary Anne (n\u00e9e Cameron, 1800- 1869) had fourteen children. Harriet (1826-1853) and Julia (1834-1853) were the fifth and eighth respectively of the Swans' nine daughters. Harriet married an army officer named Edmund Isdell in Hobart in December 1850. Her first child, a daughter, was born at the Swan family home, Beaulieu, in present-day North Hobart, in December the following year. In July 1853, Harriet gave birth to a son but died a fortnight later, presumably of complications arising from childbirth. Julia died of scarlet fever, aged nineteen, at Beaulieu on 6 August 1853, a week after the death of her sister.   Before being purchased by the National Portrait Gallery in 2013, these portraits were owned by a private collector who had acquired them directly from a descendant of Maria Swan, one of Harriet and Julia's many sisters.

Records show that also aboard the Earl Cornwallis was Connell's wife, Catherine, a convict under sentence of fourteen years transportation. Shortly after arriving in the colony, Connell established an ironmongery and hardware store on Pitt Street. It is believed that Catherine was assigned to her husband as his housekeeper and soon afterwards was awarded a conditional pardon. Connell prospered as a merchant and also went into farming. In 1821, he acquired 1000 acres at Quibray Bay (present-day Kurnell); and in 1828 purchased the land and saltwater marshes that in 1815 had formed the first land grant in the area. By the late 1830s, Connell owned much of the Kurnell Peninsula, but it is thought that he left the management of the Kurnell estates to his son, John junior, who made a living from the harvesting and sale of its timber. Mentions of Connell in the Colonial Secretary's records note the many substantial contracts he was awarded for the supply of meat to the Government stores, and suggest that his business interests included a pub in Windsor. He also served as a coroner and juror at inquests during the 1810s, and was engaged in various charitable and community pursuits. Connell's daughter, Margaret, married soldier and part-time explorer Thomas Laycock junior (c. 1786-1823) in Sydney in 1817. They had two sons, John Connell Laycock (b. 1818) and Elias Pearson Laycock (b. 1821).

Around 1826, he established Swan's Stores, on Elizabeth Street; by the end of the decade it was one of Hobart's best shops, trading in clothing, millinery, fabrics ('which for quality and fashion have never been equalled in the colony') and also 'household furniture and upholstery of the best description'. Swan and his wife Mary Anne (n\u00e9e Cameron, 1800- 1869) had fourteen children. Harriet (1826-1853) and Julia (1834-1853) were the fifth and eighth respectively of the Swans' nine daughters. Harriet married an army officer named Edmund Isdell in Hobart in December 1850. Her first child, a daughter, was born at the Swan family home, Beaulieu, in present-day North Hobart, in December the following year. In July 1853, Harriet gave birth to a son but died a fortnight later, presumably of complications arising from childbirth. Julia died of scarlet fever, aged nineteen, at Beaulieu on 6 August 1853, a week after the death of her sister.

At the Playbox Theatre on Rowe Street in 1925, Desmond appeared in the leading role in Zola's Therese Raquin. Through the Playbox, she met the English-born actor Teddy Howell, whom she married after acting for a year in Hobart.

Their only child, Leslie Nichol Walford junior, who was to achieve renown as an interior decorator, was born in 1927. Following her husband's death in 1929, Dora became increasingly involved in charity and fundraising work. In 1936, as Dora Sheller (and a widow for the second time), she helped establish the Black  White Committee of the Royal Blind Society of NSW, and served as the Committee's first president. In 1938, Dora left Sydney for England accompanied by Leslie and her third husband, Ben Knowles-Davies (who died in the course of the journey). In England during the war, Dora worked as a salvage officer for Winchester County Council. She married again in 1944; her fourth husband, Lawrence Byrne, was then serving with the British army.

He was soon in demand as a portrait painter, many of his subjects coming from high-ranking sections of the military and society, including royalty. Between 1935 and 1955, he created portraits of sitters such as King George V; Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother; and Field-Marshal Viscount Montgomery. He also exhibited regularly throughout this period, often with large scale genre paintings dealing with subjects such as mythology, war and historical scenes. His obituary in The Times recalled him as 'a very gentle man, and immaculately turned out, choosing always to paint, no matter what the subject, in one of the same Savile Row tailored suits that he might wear to one of his exhibition openings'.

Widely credited as the first Aboriginal person to graduate from an Australian university, he gained a BA from the University of Sydney in 1966. That year, he was a prominent organiser of and participant in the anti-discrimination 'freedom rides' through country New South Wales, foregrounding educational and health issues amongst rural Indigenous people and exposing entrenched racism by demanding entry to venues such as clubs and swimming pools that denied access to Aborigines. Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s he was involved in a great number of bodies promoting Aboriginal rights, welfare and advancement. In 1972, in which year he received a kidney transplant, he appeared at the Tent Embassy; five years later, having weathered a suspension from the Commonwealth public service and published his autobiography, A Bastard Like Me (1975), he became an assistant secretary in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. His public service career culminated in his serving as Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs from 1984 to 1989.

In her early years in London, she was a friend and model for her fellow Ashton School student, George Lambert, and encountered many of the major figures of the Edwardian art world. When she returned permanently to Sydney in 1921, her art and ideas were at the forefront of contemporary art and design in Australia; her authoritative opinions on decoration, colour, interior design, flower arrangement, ballet and fashion were widely published in new journals such as The Home (for which she designed many covers) and Art in Australia. An exhibitor in the watershed Burdekin House exhibition in 1929, she was a mentor and champion for young interior designers including Marion Hall Best. Although she maintained many close friends (and adversaries), she was a lifelong singleton, living very frugally in rented accommodation, making a slender living from drawing classes, periodic exhibitions at the Macquarie Galleries and commissioned drawings of Eastern Suburbs children. The National Portrait Gallery's 2005 exhibition The World of Thea Proctor was the first large-scale survey of Proctor's work in all mediums and periods; the publication that accompanied the exhibition comprises the first extended biography of the artist. Building upon her interest in drawing, Proctor made a study of lithography during her second period in London. From this time come the lithographs Mother and son (1915), Before rehearsal (1919) and The balcony (c. 1919), each of which features George Lambert's sons. When she returned to Australia she briefly championed the art form. She drew this self portrait on a lithographic stone at the Fine Art Society Gallery in Melbourne to demonstrate the technique to observers. Proctor's lithographs were deprecated by local critics and subsequently - influenced to some degree by Margaret Preston, from whom she became estranged - she turned to making the decorative woodcuts for which she is now best known.

At the same time, he began drawing cartoons, and in the mid-1960s his work began to appear in such varied publications as Woman's Day and London's Oz magazine. He served as resident cartoonist for the afternoon paper Newsday before gaining wider recognition in the 1970s with his work for the Nation Review. In his earliest work Leunig endeavoured to conduct himself as a classic political cartoonist; but in 1969, frustrated by the genre's conventions, he submitted a cartoon of a man wearing a teapot on his head riding into a sunset on a large duck. It was published, and Leunig would later come to see it as a symbolic depiction of his own escape from the strictures of political cartooning. His subsequent work - in which the duck has frequently reappeared, along with such characters as gentle Vasco Pyjama and humble Mr Curly - has been adapted for television, theatre and radio, and has been collected in many books, beginning with The Penguin Leunig (1974). Describing his own approach as 'regressive, humorous, messy, mystical, primal and vaudevillian', over decades he has persisted in his effort to convey ideas of an innocent and sacred personal world, and the fragile relationships and ecosystems of the world we share. He is a regular contributor to the Melbourne Age - in which his cartoons generally appear three to four times a week - and the Sydney Morning Herald.

Afterwards, in partnership with a Victorian named John Conway (1842-1909), Gregory put together a side to play a series of matches in England. Recruited were New South Welshmen Frederick Spofforth (1853-1926), William (Billy) Murdoch (1854-1911), Thomas Garrett (1858-1943), Charles Bannerman (1851-1930), and his brother, Alec (1854- 1924); Victorians Francis (Frank) Allan (1849-1917), Thomas Horan (1854-1916), John McCarthy (Jack) Blackham (1854-1932) and Henry Boyle (1847-1907); and a Tasmanian, George Bailey (1853-1926). Another player, Billy Midwinter (1851-1890), joined the team in England but defected halfway through the tour to play for Gloucestershire. The players and their two managers (Conway and William Gibbes) contributed \u00a350 each to finance the tour, playing a number of warm-up matches against local teams before leaving for England in March 1878. They defeated a Marylebone Cricket Club eleven (captained by WG Grace) by nine wickets at Lord's in May 1878, bowling them out for 33 and 19, with Australian fast bowler Spofforth -  aka 'The Demon' -  taking six wickets for four runs in the first innings and four for sixteen in the second. Then, between June and September, the team played games against Middlesex, Surrey and Gloucestershire (Spofforth again being the main destroyer); and en route home stopped in America for fixtures in Philadelphia and San Francisco. A crowd of 20,000 people is said to have welcomed them back to Sydney at the conclusion of the tour, which had proved an enormous financial as well as sporting success. Spofforth, Murdoch, Horan, Garrett, Blackham and Alec Bannerman all featured in the Australian outfit whose defeat of England at The Oval in August 1882 initiated 'The Ashes' test series - still arguably international cricket's most storied rivalry.

Born in England, Sayers came to Australia with his parents at the age of six and grew up in Mount Kuring-gai. A keen artist and observer of nature from boyhood, he formed a precocious determination to become an art historian and graduated in Art History from the University of Sydney in 1979. Having been Registrar of Collections at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, in 1981 he became Assistant Director at the Newcastle Region Art Gallery. In 1985 he moved to Canberra, where he became Assistant Director (Collections) at the National Gallery of Australia. In 1989 he published Drawing in Australia, and in 1994 Aboriginal Artists of the 19th Century, a work for which he received the HE Stanner Award of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. Appointed Director of the new National Portrait Gallery in April 1998, Sayers signalled his exciting vision for the institution with The Possibilities of Portraiture, comprising a mixture of historical and contemporary works in various media. In his first year at the Gallery - while writing, in his spare time, Australian Art for the Oxford History of Art series - he established policy, made press appearances, commissioned artworks, wrote acquisition proposals for individual works and researched, wrote and edited text for display in the Gallery. Over eleven years, during which the staff of the Gallery increased fivefold, he conceived or worked in partnership to create the exhibitions Arthur Boyd Portraits (1999-2000); Heads of the People (2000); Nolan Heads (2001); Intimate Portraits (2002); Contemporary Australian Portraits (2002-2003); POL: Portrait of a generation (2003); To Look Within: Self-portraits in Australia (2004); The World of Thea Proctor (2005); Clifton Pugh Australians (2005-2006) and Open Air: Portraits in the landscape (2008). Meanwhile, he pressed for a dedicated building for the National Portrait Gallery. In early 2010 Sayers accepted the position of Director of the National Museum of Australia, where he oversaw major building works and staff restructuring and vitalised the display. Between 2005 and 2014 he ran 15 marathons, but in his all-too-brief retirement, he concentrated on painting full-time; his commanding self-portrait was a finalist in the Moran Prize of 2014 and his portrait of Tim Bonyhady was a finalist in the Archibald of 2015.

Returning to Sydney in the early 1930s, they moved to Rosemont, a colonial-era mansion in Woollahra, which subsequently became famous for the many receptions and other functions Hannah hosted there. Active on behalf of charities including the Royal Blind Society, Legacy and Barnardo's and organisations such as the National Trust, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and St John's Ambulance, Hannah was a leading member of Sydney society and known for her tastes in matters of fashion, interior decoration, fine art and gardening. She was awarded an OBE for her charity work in 1955.

Munich-born and educated in Vienna and Paris, he became interested in photography while working for Deutsche Bank in London in the early 1900s. He established his own studio in 1907; co-founded the London Salon of Photography in 1910; and held his first solo exhibition in 1911. That year, he produced a series of portraits of the dancers of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. Aiming to create portraits wherein 'character rather than flattery [was] the dominant note', he photographed such luminaries as Albert Einstein, HG Wells, Virginia Woolf and Rudyard Kipling, along with world leaders and royalty. His photographs appeared in Vogue, Vanity Fair and Tatler and he published some twenty-eight books of his work. Commissioned to create a photographic portrait of Australia, he arrived in Sydney in 1930 and spent the next ten months travelling throughout the country. He published the results of his visit to Australia in The Fifth Continent (1931). The National Portrait Gallery, London, holds more than 150 of his photographs.

Colebee soon escaped, but Bennelong - described as 'of good stature, and stoutly made, with a bold, intrepid countenance which bespoke defiance and revenge' - chose to remain with his captors for several months, readily learning English, adopting European ways and exchanging names with Phillip in order to establish a form of kinship with him. Bennelong became a canny intermediary between the two cultures and often successfully manipulated the governor's favour to his own advantage. The two remained on good terms after the spearing of Phillip at Manly in September 1790 - an incident which some historians believe was a ritual punishment of Phillip for Bennelong's imprisonment, along with other wrongs. Phillip, for his part, saw much value in the relationship and on his return to England in 1792 took Bennelong and his kinsman, Yemmerrawanne, with him in observance of the curious tradition of introducing Indigenous people into London society. Bennelong returned to Sydney in 1795. After some years, he left the Sydney Cove settlement and became the leader of a group of Aboriginal people living near Kissing Point on the Parramatta River, but was scorned by some members of the white community for choosing to return to his traditional lifestyle. In 1802, when a member of Nicolas Baudin's expedition suggested that he travel to France, Bennelong asserted that 'there was no better country than his own and that he did not wish to leave it'.

He served a two- year apprenticeship on a whaling vessel before joining the Royal Navy, aged seventeen, in 1755. Phillip saw action in the Mediterranean, the West Indies, South America and Europe and served four years with the Portuguese navy before being given command of a Royal Navy vessel and rising to the rank of post-captain in 1781. Phillip's varied experience, along with his reliability and knowledge of matters such as farming and convict transportation, are counted among the reasons why, in October 1786, he was given the task of establishing a new colony on the east coast of Australia. The First Fleet sailed from Portsmouth in May 1787 and arrived in Botany Bay in January 1788. Phillip soon after relocated to a cove in Port Jackson, naming the settlement after Lord Sydney, the English politician who had appointed him the colony's first governor. During Phillip's governorship, the settlement experienced periods of extreme disquiet and uncertainty and critical shortages of food. Yet he had great hopes for the colony and is noted for his remarkable efforts at establishing peaceful relationships with Sydney's Indigenous people. Contemporaries described Phillip as a humane, exceedingly honest and diligent man with a warm sense of humour who was progressive in many of his ideas. He returned to England in 1792, but maintained a keen interest in New South Wales. He died in Bath in August 1814, shortly after having been promoted to Admiral. Painter Francis Wheatley (1747- 1801) was known for his portraits which typically presented his subjects in finely realised landscapes or interiors. His conversation pieces, such as his series of depictions of street vendors titled 'Cries of London', exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1792 and 1795, were also highly regarded. This portrait is an engraving of one of Wheatley's two paintings of Arthur Phillip. The better-known of the two, now in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London, shows Phillip in his naval uniform and standing on a beach; while the painting on which this engraving is based shows him holding a document inscribed 'New South Wales, 1787'. Both portraits are presumed to have been made to mark Phillip's appointment to the command of the new colony.

As the Barkly family progressed to Mauritius, Bourbon and the Cape, Lady Barkly collected plant specimens; she corresponded with Joseph Dalton Hooker about stapelias, (odoriferous succulents in which Henry Barkly was very interested), and compiled A Revised List of the Ferns of South Africa. She is listed in the Dictionary of British and Irish Botanists, as is her step-daughter, Emily Blanche Barkly. Lady Barkly outlived her husband by 34 years.

From 1788 to about 1810, though Banks held no official post, he was effectively head of Australian affairs in Britain. For this reason, he has often been called 'the Father and Founder of the Australian colonies.'

Although wanting to remain in England, he was sent to form a settlement in Bass Strait and sailed for Port Phillip in 1803. The chosen site (near present-day Sorrento) proved unsuitable, bringing about the settlement's removal to the Derwent River and the founding of Hobart in February 1804.

Poche went on to found Startrack Express, and become one of Australia's wealthiest men. Richardson became involved with diverse businesses, including information storage and management, service industries, wholesale pharmaceutical distribution, property development and investment. Having persuaded Poche to donate $40 million toward a purpose-built facility for melanoma research, Reg Richardson was appointed the chairman of the Melanoma Institute Australia in 2007. Richardson further encouraged Poche to donate $10 million to toward the establishment of the Poche Centre for Indigenous Health at the University of Sydney and together the two men founded the Poche Indigenous Health Network, with research units at Flinders and Melbourne universities. A lifelong Catholic and supporter of the South Sydney Rabbitohs, Richardson is also a very significant art collector who has served on the boards of the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Art Gallery of NSW Foundation as well as the Mercy Foundation, St Vincent's Hospital and the Ted Noffs Foundation. His own charitable contributions combine with those he has coaxed from others to comprise some $120 million for the public good; now, Richardson's passion is encouraging well-to-do Australians to follow his philanthropic lead.   Mitch Cairns, painter and cartoonist, completed his undergraduate study at the National Art School, Sydney in 2006, halfway through his three years as studio assistant to the late Adam Cullen. Immediately after graduation he began participating in group shows in Tasmania, Sydney and Melbourne; soon, he co-founded an artist-run space, The Cosmic Battle for Your Heart, which operated from 2009 to 2011. Cairns's awards include the Brett Whiteley Traveling Art Scholarship, which included a residency at the Cit\u00e9 internationale des arts, Paris in 2013, and he has been a finalist in many leading art prizes. He was named the Archibald runner-up in both 2014 and 2015, first with this portrait of Richardson and secondly with a portrait of an older artist, Peter Powditch.   Reg Richardson first acquired Mitch Cairns's work while Cairns was still at art school. 'In making this portrait,' the artist stated alongside his Archibald entry: 'I tried to depict something of the way Reg conducts himself. His manner is characterised by an air of casual distinction in which education, wit and anecdote sit comfortably without pretension. He is both affable and compelling; a tireless champion for all that he believes in. I hope this portrait, like Reg, is somewhat humble yet at the same time resonant with magnitude.'

He taught throughout the 1960s at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology; meanwhile, in 1964, he joined the stable of artists associated with the Rudy Komon Art Gallery in Sydney.  Senbergs has developed a vocabulary of seemingly sinister images of the modern industrial city, which have often been interpreted - for instance, by Bernard Smith - as 'dreary emblems of humankind polluted materially and spiritually by the advanced technological society'. He sees himself, however, as an 'image maker', whose method is to paint abstract shapes, with little preconception, then unite elements from printmaking and photography with the outlines he has made. In the mid-1970s he was the Creative Arts Fellow at ANU, and between 1977 and 1980 he made a huge anodised aluminium six-panel mural for the 'Constitution Wall' of the public hall of the High Court. Here he began a friendship with the architect Colin Madigan, which resulted in a collaborative exhibition documenting the sinking of the HMAS Armidale, Armidale '42 Memory and Imagination, exhibited at the National Gallery in 2000.  Senbergs is well-known for his fantastically intricate, messy drawings, including the huge quartet Kitchen at Smacka's in the Art Gallery of New South Wales, as well as depictions of Antarctica that he made after a visit in 1987. The Art Gallery of New South Wales mounted Jan Senbergs: From screenprinter to painter in 2008, and the National Gallery of Victoria held a major retrospective of his work in 2016.

His first films, including Illuminations (1976) and Kostas (1979) dealt with the experience of European migrants in Australia. He came to widespread notice, in Australia and internationally, with Lonely Hearts (1981), Man of Flowers (1983) and My First Wife (1984). Between 1970 and 2007 he made 20 feature films, three children's films, an IMAX feature, ten documentaries and twelve shorts. Influenced by a roll-call of European filmmakers including Ingmar Bergman, Jacques Tati and Luis Buuel, in films including A Woman's Tale (1991), Molokai (1999), Innocence (2000) and Nijinsky: The diaries of Vaslav Nijinsky (2001) Cox pursued his conviction that film is the medium that can 'penetrate and then project one's inner side'. Tales of his artistic and financial struggles make for absorbing reading. Known to many as 'the father of independent art cinema in Australia', he has also been described as Australia's first cinematic auteur. Cox's book Reflections: An Autobiographical Journey was published in 1998. His last film venture, Force of Destiny (2015) drew on his own experience of a liver transplant following cancer; ultimately, the disease returned in the new organ.

Marriage to painter Peter Freeman took her to the Middle East and London, where she worked at the British Council. Returning to Melbourne, mother of two children, she began working in publishing at Penguin; she worked at McKinsey as their first female writer, then as a consultant; and later at William Heinemann, where she commissioned books about Australian history.  With Patricia Edgar, she wrote a pictorial essay, Media She, which is a key document of second-wave Australian feminism. In 1973, having become associated with the Women's Electoral Lobby (WEL) she collaborated on an illustrated magazine, the WEL Papers, with Diana Gribble. In 1975 the pair became founding directors of McPhee Gribble Publishers. The success of one of their early ventures, the Practical Puffins series for Penguin Australia, financed the publication of books by new authors including Helen Garner, Kathy Lette and Tim Winton.  Incorporating a pioneering childcare room, the McPhee Gribble headquarters moved from Carlton to Fitzroy and expanded its staff; the founders divided the responsibilities, with McPhee in charge of content and Gribble, production and distribution. With a commitment to independence, postcolonial direction and the 'best Australian writing', McPhee Gribble published several hundred titles. In 1979 the women co-founded Sisters Publishing, a mail order feminist book club which lasted for five years. With the economic downturn at the end of the 1980s McPhee Gribble was sold to Penguin, where it continued under its own imprint, producing Drusilla Modjeska's Poppy, Tim Winton's Cloudstreet, and Helen Garner's Cosmo Cosmolino, amongst others. At the completion of her contract with Penguin McPhee moved to MacMillan, where she directed the Picador imprint until 1994; its titles included Winton's The Riders and Garner's The First Stone.  Headhunted by Paul Keating, she oversaw the controversial reformation of the Australia Council from 1994 to 1997. (At the time, she was married to Keating's speechwriter, Don Watson.)

After he died, several papers lamented that he had not completed an account of his own life, times and acquaintances. ", "title": "James T.

Born in Bundaberg, she was the daughter of a Mauritian circus artist and his Australian wife, but was adopted in 1901 by Mary 'Marizles' Wirth, of the famous Wirth Brothers' Circus troupe. May had been introduced to acrobatics, tightrope walking and other tricks by her father, and her adoptive family soon added equestrian stunts to her repertoire. After a star turn with Wirth Brothers' Circus in Sydney in 1911, Marizles took May to the USA, where she was signed for two seasons with Barnum  Bailey. She made her American debut at Madison Square Garden in 1912, and later performed in the UK and Europe with Marizles and her step-sister, Stella. As the 'Royal Wirth Family' the trio featured alongside other dazzling international artistes in Wirth Brothers' 1915-1916 Australasian tour. One report described a stunt wherein May somersaulted from the back of one horse to another galloping behind it, 'thereby earning salvos of applause from the big audience present'. Returning to America in 1917, the 'Wizard Rider' again headlined with Barnum  Bailey, remaining the star equestrienne attraction until she left the company in the late-1920s.

Aged 16, he joined the Royal Navy, and at age 22, he was appointed to Cook's third voyage as Master of HMS Resolution. On the voyage he honed the exceptional navigational skills that would become, along with volatility and authoritarianism, his best-known characteristics. In 1787, he was appointed to command HMS Bounty on a voyage to Tahiti, a journey that ended for Bligh in April 1789 in mutiny. According to Bligh's account, he was dragged from his cabin at sunrise, bound and repeatedly threatened with death before being set adrift in the ship's launch with his supporters. The voyage that ensued is considered one of history's most remarkable feats of seamanship, as Bligh, with minimal provisions and no maps, successfully navigated the open boat over 3000 miles to Timor, losing only one of his men and during the voyage charting part of the coast of Australia. In 1805, on the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks, Bligh was appointed governor of New South Wales, taking up the post in August 1806 with a brief to curb the trade in rum and the influence of powerful, wealthy colonists. Again, despite his general integrity, Bligh's abrasive manner and rigid adherence to orders created conflict over issues such as land, planning and convict labour. This led ultimately to Australia's first and only military coup, the so-called 'Rum Rebellion' of January 1808, wherein Bligh was deposed by the New South Wales Corps and held under house arrest in Sydney for more than a year. After returning to England in 1810, Bligh was eventually promoted to Vice Admiral. He died in London, survived by his six daughters.

After war service he resumed his studies, and in 1949 secured a job in the National Gallery of Victoria's Print Room, where he worked until 1951, leaving to take up the position of art master at Melbourne Grammar School. His paintings succeeded immediately; his first exhibited work, Barber's Shop, was purchased for the NGV in 1953 as was Collins Street, 5p.m. three years later. In 1962 he became Head of the National Gallery Art School. Six years later, finally confident that he could make a living as a full-time artist, he resigned. He painted shopfronts, school yards, gardens and housing estates, nudes, office workers, ballroom dancers, jockeys, brides, drinkers, commissioned portraits and portraits of friends and family. In recent years The Bar 1954 and The Old Time 1969 have set new auction records for the sale of Australian paintings. Brack painted 35 portraits in oils. The brilliant double portrait with which he is pictured here is his largest and most ambitious; Patrick McCaughey wrote to him 'It is a remarkable achievement to pull of the double portrait in 1978 - what an argument it makes for your stubbornness!' Alexander George Mitchell (1911-1997), academic, studied English literature and language at the University of Sydney and the University of London before joining the English department of the University of Sydney, where he assumed the McCaughey Chair of Early English Literature and Language in 1947. In 1961 he became deputy vice-chancellor. Mitchell's research into Australian English was profoundly influential, demonstrating that the speech of Australians had its own history, legitimately distinct from 'Standard English' or 'Received Pronunciation' of which, until then, it had been deemed an undesirable corruption. His books included The Pronunciation of English in Australia (1946, and revised edition 1957 with Arthur Delbridge), The Use of English (1954) and The Speech of Australian Adolescents (with Delbridge, 1965).A member of the interim council charged with planning a third university for Sydney - Macquarie University - and later vice-chair of that university's first council, Mitchell became Macquarie's foundation Vice-Chancellor in 1965.Mitchell saw the university grow exponentially and championed its innovative character, which fostered a broad liberal education through large multidisciplinary schools and engagement with industry, commerce and the community. He oversaw the establishment of the groundbreaking Social Sciences Resource Centre in 1974. Although he was never one of its editors, his interest in Australian English is credited with having informed the development of the Macquarie Dictionary, first published in 1981 and revised for several editions since. The Rt Hon Sir Garfield Barwick AK GCMG KC (1903-97), Chief Justice of Australia from 27 April 1964 to 11 February 1981, was the longest serving Chief Justice of Australia. Barwick grew up in impoverished circumstances in the then-slum suburb of Stanmore in Sydney, but gained a scholarship to Fort Street School and took the University Medal in Law at the University of Sydney. Admitted to the bar in 1927, appointed King's Counsel in 1941 and taking silk in 1942, he came to public attention as the prosecuting attorney in the Dobell case. During the war he defended various businesses against wartime regulations, opposing attorney general 'Doc' Evatt (who called him 'Bushy Tail') and becoming a regular before the Privy Council. Later he was Menzies's choice to advocate the banning of the Communist Party, and he represented ASIO in the Petrov Royal Commission in 1954. In 1958 he was elected Liberal member for Parramatta; he was Attorney-General from 1958 to 1961, and Minister for External Affairs from 1961 to 1964, during which period Gough Whitlam was named in Parliament for calling him a 'truculent runt'. In 1964 he left parliament, and was appointed a Privy Counsellor; he served as Chief Justice for the next 17 years. In this capacity he provided official advice to his friend John Kerr, confirming the legality of the Dismissal. Barwick was Chancellor of Macquarie University from 1967 to 1978; during this period he took an active interest in the design and construction of the High Court building - accordingly dubbed 'Gar's Mahal' - which opened in Canberra in 1980. David Marr's hostile biography, Barwick - his first book - was published that year. In retirement Barwick wrote Sir John Did His Duty (1983) and a personal 'apologia', Radical Tory (1995).

Recipient of various gravelling grants in the 1960s and 1970s, from 1958 to 1995 he held about twenty solo exhibitions at Macquarie Galleries in Sydney and Solander in Canberra; he won many modest art prizes between 1962 and 1972.

Kelly and his siblings were raised by their mother, Ellen Kelly, (ne\u00e9 Quinn) after the death of their father, an Irish former convict. The family was in constant conflict with the authorities. Ned Kelly, implicated in the criminal activities of the Quinn clan, was charged with several offences over the 1860s and 1870s and spent some years in prison. A police crackdown led to the arrest of Mrs Kelly in April 1878. In October of that year, Sir Redmond Barry sentenced her to three years' hard labour. Around the time of their mother's sentencing, Ned and Dan Kelly went into hiding in the Wombat Ranges near Mansfield, Victoria. A police party comprising Sergeant Kennedy and Constables Lonigan, Scanlon and McIntyre was dispatched to capture them. On 25 October 1878 the officers camped at Stringybark Creek, where Ned marked them. The next day, when Kennedy and Scanlon went out to search the surrounding bush, the 'Kelly gang' - Ned, Dan, Joe Byrne and Steve Hart - ambushed Lonigan and McIntyre. Ned Kelly shot Lonigan dead as the officer drew his revolver. McIntyre surrendered, and when Kennedy and Scanlon returned, Ned called on them to do likewise. They refused; Ned Kelly killed Scanlon and mortally wounded Kennedy, later shooting him in the heart as an 'act of mercy'. McIntyre escaped to Mansfield and related the story to his colleagues. Within weeks, the Victorian government advertised huge rewards for the Kelly gang members, and these rewards increased in the months to come, as the gang's exploits multiplied and Ned composed the 'Jerilderie letter' expatiating on his motives. They avoided capture until they arrived in the town of Glenrowan in June 1880, intending to ambush a police train. In the town's inn, Kelly, wearing a homemade suit of metal armour, was wounded in a 'siege' in which Dan Kelly, Byrne and Hart all died. Kelly survived, only to be hanged in Melbourne Gaol on 11 November 1880. Maximilian Kreitmayer (1830-1906), medical modeller and waxworks proprietor, came to Victoria in 1856 and opened a grisly anatomical museum. By 1862 he had established a museum in Melbourne, and he soon launched similar ventures in Sydney, Adelaide and Hobart. From 1869 he owned Melbourne's only waxworks - its Chamber of Horrors including the Kelly gang. Following the execution of a notorious prisoner, it was customary for a death mask to be made. Kreitmayer is said to have shaved Kelly's hair and beard, and taken the mould of his face in the deadhouse of the Melbourne Gaol.
